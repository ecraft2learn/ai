<h2>Student projects</h2>
<p>While students have been doing projects using the AI Snap! blocks for a long time we only recently began collecting them.</p>
<h3>Work experience student October 2019</h3>
<p>
A 15-year old male student explored using custom speech recognition and image recognition as a user interface to maze puzzles.
He wrote in <a href="maze-report.html">his report</a>
that while he trained models for both speech and image recognition,
he ran out of time integrating the visual recognition into his project.

<a href="maze (12).xml" download>Download his project.</a>

<h3>Work experience student May 2018</h3>
<p>
This male 15-year old student did these projects in the week we hosted him:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=balls%20and%20boxes%20" target="_blank">balls and boxes</a>
- I made this to test the bouncing features and as a nice small game
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=Balls%20and%20Boxes%202" target="_blank">balls and boxes 2</a>
- I made this to build upon what I had made in balls and boxes one. It is more advanced with changing backgrounds and balls which faze off screen.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=Balls%20and%20Boxes%202%20with%20song!" target="_blank">balls and boxes 2 with song!</a>
- This is a copy  of balls and boxes 2 with a theme song. I made this to test out the speech synthesis.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=box%20open" target="_blank">box open</a>
- this was made to to see if I could make a game about a random drop box
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=fish%20game%20" target="_blank">Fish game</a>
- this is the second most advanced game I made. It was to practice my basic skills and it turned out quite fun, I got a record score of 13!
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=fish%20game%20with%20voices" target="_blank">Fish game with voices</a>
- This is the most advanced game (maybe) that i created. It is a copy of Fish game but it has text and speach.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=Monster" target="_blank">monster</a>
- This was made to test speech synthesis, all the blocks lie in a nest so it is more reliable.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dominicchild&ProjectName=second%20project" target="_blank">second project</a>
- This has less code than the fish game but it uses higher blocks which are very advanced, this was made to test video recognition and computer learning.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Work experience student July 2018</h3>
<p>
This female 16 year old wrote a <a href="Spelling Game Project Report.docx" download>report</a> about her
<a href="Spelling Game Project.xml" download>spelling game</a> (using speech synthesis and recognition and word embeddings)
and another <a href="Painting Program Project Report.docx" download>report</a> about her
<a href="Painting Program Project.xml" download>painting program</a> (using speech synthesis and recognition and pose detection).
Import these programs into <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html">Snap!</a>.
</p>
<h3>Work experience student October 2018</h3>
<p>
Another male 15 year old built
<a href="audio adventure V1.9.xml" download>a speech-oriented equivalent of a text-based adventure game</a>.
The program repeatedly speaks a description of a scene and then responds to spoken commands.
To run his program import it into <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html">Snap!</a>.
