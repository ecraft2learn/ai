At the beginning of the week I was a bit confused with the program and the website as I think I was somewhat over complicating it in my head,
where in fact it is arranged in a format that actually makes it quite easy to use.
Once I realised this I started to experiment with the program Snap! and
began to make a few simple programs to fully understand the basics of how to use it.
And I then continued to slowly increase the complexity of these programs and started to build a few more challenging and interesting programs,
such as a few games with interesting features such as a brick-and-ball game,
and a maze game that I had hoped to further develop into a game resembling pac-man.
</p>
<p>
The final program I decided to use was the maze program, although in its most basic format it wasn’t all that interesting,
I thought that it would be the best program to integrate cool features such as a way to control the movement of a character with anything
from the movement of the players eyes to movement of their head or even just for the character to move in the direction that the player was pointing.
And while I didn’t manage to include these features due to timing issues,
I did first include an idea of levels, lives, and a point based system to control this - 
along with the ability to turn on and off a voice control command option, in addition to the use of the arrow keys to move the character.

While there was a lot to refine with the program - such as the visual aspects of the program,
I would say I'm relatively happy with the final result.
Like I already said I was hoping to further develop the game into a pac-man type thing,
and am considering potentially continuing with the program in the future to achieve this.
