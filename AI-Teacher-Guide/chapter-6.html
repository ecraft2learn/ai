<h3 class="background-information-white">Introduction</h3>
<p class="background-information">
In previous chapters you used blocks that relied upon pre-trained machine learning models.
In some cases using transfer learning you were able to extend the models a little.
In this chapter we introduce blocks that enable you to create deep machine learning models from scratch,
train them, and use their predictions in your projects.
We have yet to include support for models that use images or sounds but there is a good deal one can do with numbers.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
One can build models that learn about real-world data such as weather, traffic, astronomy, economics, politics, 
and any of the many other
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/02/26/big-data-and-ai-30-amazing-and-free-public-data-sources-for-2018/" target="_blank">
open data sources</a>.
You can build models that will try to guess the next number in a sequence.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
As we explore later in this chapter one can <a href="#tic-tac-toe">create intelligent game playing programs</a> using these machine learning blocks.
The trick is to turn game boards/positions into a list of numbers and the game outcome into a number so the model can be trained on previous games.
</p>
<h3 class="instructions-white">How to Use Machine Learning Blocks</h3>
<p class="instructions">
To create and use a machine learning model you need these components:
</p>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>
Create a model with the desired number and size of layers.
The model will connect the input to the first layer, the first layer to second layer, and so on until the last layer with is the output of the model.
More layers and wider layers typically makes the model more accurate but also slower to train and use.
</li>
<li>
Provide the data as two lists.
The elements of the first list are the input and the second list contains the corresponding outputs.
</li>
<li>
Train the model.
You can control how much learning it does on each step and how many steps it should run.
Very many small steps usually works best but can take a very long time.
</li>
<li>
Use the model to make predictions.
This can be done with test data where the outputs are known to evaluate the model.
And once it passes your tests you can use to predict things about the world, solve mathematics puzzles, or play games.
</li>
</ol>
