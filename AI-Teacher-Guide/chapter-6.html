This chapter of the guide relies upon a library for machine learning that currently runs best in the Chrome browser.

<h4 class="background-information-white" id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p class="background-information">
In previous chapters you used blocks that relied upon pre-trained machine learning models.
In some cases, using transfer learning you were able to extend the models a little.
In this chapter we introduce blocks that enable you to create deep machine learning models from scratch,
train them, and use their predictions in your projects.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
One can build models that learn about real-world data such as weather, traffic, astronomy, economics, politics, 
and any of the many other
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/02/26/big-data-and-ai-30-amazing-and-free-public-data-sources-for-2018/" target="_blank">
open data sources</a>.
You can build models that will try to guess the next number in a sequence.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
Neural nets can only process numeric data.
This isn't a great limitation however since we provide blocks that convert text, images, and sounds into numbers:
</p>
<ul  class="background-information">
<li>
<b>Words.</b> The <span class="block-name">features of word</span> and <span class="block-name">features of sentence</span> blocks produce
lists of numbers for single words and whole sentences.
See <a href="#confidences">this example of a model trained to predict the level of confidence indicated by a sentence</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Images.</b> The <span class="block-name">get costume features of ...</span> block reports a list of numbers for an image (i.e. a Snap! costume).
</li>
<li>
<b>Sounds.</b> Not yet implemented.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="background-information">
As we explore later in this chapter one can <a href="#tic-tac-toe">create intelligent game playing programs</a>
using these machine learning blocks.
The trick is to turn game boards/positions into a list of numbers and the game outcome into a number
so the model can be trained on records of previous games.
</p>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="how-to-use-ml-blocks">How to Use Machine Learning Blocks</h4>
<p class="instructions">
To create and use a machine learning model you need these components:
</p>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>
Create a model with the desired number and size of layers.
The model will connect the input to the first layer, the first layer to the second layer,
and so on until the last layer which is the output of the model.
More layers and wider layers typically makes the model more accurate but also slower to train and use.
</li>
<li>
Provide the data as two lists.
The elements of the first list are the input and the second list contains the corresponding outputs.
Note that the elements of the lists can be numbers or lists of numbers.
</li>
<li>
Train the model.
You can control how much learning it does on each step and how many steps it should run.
Using very many small steps usually works, but can take a very long time.
You can use advanced optimization methods to adjust the steps and improve the training.
</li>
<li>
Use the model to make predictions.
A good way to evaluate the model is to use test data that wasn't used in training. 
If it makes good predictions on the test data you can use it to predict things about the world,
solve mathematics puzzles, or play games.
</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="small-ml-example">A small example: Training a model to estimate square roots</h4>
<p class="instructions">
In the following you can use the <span class="block-name">Create a neural net model ...</span>
block to create a model with four "hidden" layers.
(Hidden in that they are in-between the input and the output.)
You then use the <span class="block-name">Send training data ...</span>
block to set the training data to ten numbers and their square roots.
Next you can use the <span class="block-name">Train model named ...</span> block to train the model. 
This can take several seconds and you should finally see the remaining "error"
(often called the "loss"), the accuracy, and how long it took.
Smaller errors are better.
Finally, you can use the <span class="block-name">Get predictions from model ...</span> block
(the version that gets only one prediction at a time)
to test how well the model has learned.
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "machine learning exercise"
        stage_ratio = ".6"

        caption = "Create, train, and test a simple model. TRY IT!">
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
You will notice that it is hard to train the model to compute square root estimates very well.
There are full-featured versions of blocks for creating and training models that enable you to alter more parameters.
We suggest you first experiment with what are called the <i>hyperparameters</i> such as
the number and size of the layers, the optimizer, the learning rate, the loss function,
the validation split, and the number of learning steps.
With the right settings the following can create a good square root estimator.
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "better machine learning exercise"
        full_screen = "true"
        edit_mode = "true"
        stage_ratio = ".6"
        container_style = "width: 1300px; height: 1350px" 
        caption = "Create, train, and test a simple model using full-featured blocks. TRY IT!">
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
By changing the input and output lists you can make a model that computes different functions.
For example, you could train a model to convert from Centigrade to Fahrenheit.
Try a few functions and see if some are easier to train than others.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
The machine learning blocks are not restricted to learning how to map one input number to an output number.
A simple example is
<a href="../snap/snap.html?project=predict distance&editMode" target="_blank">
a model that estimates the distance a point is from the origin</a>.
Given values for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> it estimates the square root of the sum of the squares of each.
</p>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="training-to-label-data">Training a model to label data</h4>
<p class="instructions">
You can train a model to put a label on data.
For example, here is a model trained to provide a name for a color.
It was trained to output a label for a vector of three numbers:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV" target="_blank">hue, saturation, and brightness</a>.
50 different random colors were given one of nine color names.
Instead of responding with a number or a color name the model lists a "score"
for each of the possible color names. The scores add up to 1.
The percentage of confidences of each label is obtained by multiplying each score by 100.
The following model does well with only a few colors,
perhaps you can improve by training it with more colors and by training it better.
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "naming colors"
        run_full_screen = "true"
        stage_ratio = "1"
        container_style = "width: 900px; height: 700px" 
        caption = "Test a simple model that names colors. IMPROVE IT!">
</figure>
<p class="advanced-topic">
Neural nets only work with numbers so how do outputs such "red" and "green" work?
Click to learn how.
</p>
<span class="advanced-topic-body">
<p class="how-it-works">
The Snap! blocks for machine learning check if the output values are numbers.
When they aren't it collects together all the unique values (e.g., all the color names in the data).
It then uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot" target="_blank">one hot</a>.
If the colors were "red", "green", and "blue" they could be converted to 0, 1, and 2.
But it wouldn't work well since the numbers imply that "red" is closer to "green" than "blue".
Even if you think that is OK what about when one adds "white" or "black" to the list?
With one hot, red can be <1, 0, 0>, green <0, 1, 0> and blue <0, 0, 1>.
Each color is equally distant to any other this way.
</p>
<p class="how-it-works">
The model responds with predictions with a vector of numbers between 0 and 1 that add up to 1.
Each number is what the model estimates is the probability
that the correct color name is the corresponding one in the list of color names.
E.g. For if the prediction is <.5, .2, .3> for "red", "green", and "blue" then
the model is estimating that the odds of red being correct is 50%, green 20%, and blue 30%.
The Snap! model prediction blocks return a list where each element is a list of a color name and number.
The <span class="block-name">Name this color ...</span> in the above sample project
sorts the list by the probability scores and multiplies by 100 to convert to percentages.
</p>

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="noisy-polygons">Training a model to predict how you would rate abstract "art"</h4>
<p class="instructions">
One way to draw a polygon is to repeatedly go forward and turn.
E.g. a pentagon is

<img src="/ai/images/pentagon.png" class="center">
<figcaption>A pentagon drawn by repeatedly going forward and turning</figcaption>

If we add a little "noise" to the amount that the sprite goes forward or turns we get a bit more interesting result.

<img src="/ai/images/noisy pentagon.png" class="center">
<figcaption>Noisy pentagons drawn by repeatedly going forward and turning with some random noise</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
If we change the pen colour and size each time we can get some very pretty results. And some very ugly ones.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
Maybe we can train a neural network to rate how nice noisy polygons look.
In the following after giving some random noisy polygons ratings you can train it to predict ratings.
Each noisy polygon is defined by just 12 numbers: 
minimum step, maximum step, minimum turn, maximum turn, minimum red, maximum red, minimum green, maximum green, minimum blue, maximum blue,
minimum pen size, and maximum pen size.
The neural net will be trained with a collection of these 12 numbers as input and rating numbers as output.

<h4 class="how-it-works-white" id="introduction-to-deep-neural-nets">A brief introduction to deep neural nets</h4>
<p class="how-it-works">
A deep neural net consists of an input layer, some number of hidden layers, and an output layer.
The nets that the <span class="block-name">Create a neural net model ...</span> block creates
are always in a sequence and each neuron is connected to every neuron in the neighbouring layers.
While this is a common architecture there are many models that branch and are connected more sparsely.

<figcaption>A block to create the neural net in the previous figure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="how-it-works">
When predicting each neuron adds up all of its inputs from the previous layer after multiplying each input by a weight.
Instead of sending the sum out to the neurons of the next layer it first checks if the value is negative and then
sends zero instead.
(This is a popular operation on the sum but some neural net models do other mathematical operations instead.)
It is the weights (sometimes called "parameters") that are "learned" during training.
They do this using a mathematical technique called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent" target="_blank">gradient descent</a>.
It repeatedly takes small steps to reduce the "loss" or "error".
There are different strategies for doing this efficiently that are called
<a href="http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/" target="_blank">optimizers</a>.
The size of the step taken each time is called the "learning rate".
If the learning rate is too small progress is very slow.
If it is too large then the error may bounce up and down rather than making progress towards a lower value.

You can bring data into Snap! and use it to train your models.
You can find available data by doing a web search but often even better is to use
<a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch" target="_blank">Google dataset search</a>.
In the following we found two datasets to explore whether weather data can help predict incidence of influenza.
For a collection of daily weather records for hundreds of places worldwide, some going back more than one hundred years,
we used this <a href="https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/" target="_blank">weather data</a>
(documented in the readme.txt file).
And for the number of cases of flu each week across many countries we used
<a href="http://apps.who.int/flumart/Default?ReportNo=16" target="_blank">Epi Data Surveillance Information</a>
from the World Health Organisation.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
An easy way to bring data into Snap! is by importing the contents of a TXT file into a variable.
Create a variable and then right click on the variable's "watcher" and select <i>import</i>.

<p class="instructions">
Bringing data into Snap! as text is only the first step.
The Snap! <span class="block-name">split ... by</span> block can turn text into lists.
The lists often need to be cleaned up and restructured.
This is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a>.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
In this <a href="../snap/snap.html?project=weather data&editMode" target="_blank">Snap! project</a>
data wrangling is performed on both the weather and flu data.
The idea is to have each element of the weather dataset to contain the weather for a week matched up with the flu data for the following week.
One problem is that the flu data from the World Health Organisation is weekly for entire countries
while the weather data is daily for weather stations (often in cities).
In the sample project data for Ireland and Switzerland were used because a big country could have very different weather in different parts.
Also one needs to avoid datasets that are incomplete which occurs often.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
Weather and flu are seasonal so to make interesting predictions we need to say if the weather data was higher or lower than typical for that time of year
how does it predict how the flu cases will vary from what is typical for that time of year. 
To address this, the data has been regularised which in this case means that all measurements have been divided by the average value for that measurement.
So a value such as 0.75 means that reading was 75% of the average value for that measurement that week of the year.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
Another challenge is to work out how to evaluate how well a model does.
Is it good enough if the model predicts better than chance given a week's weather data whether the next week's flu reports will be above or below average?
Or should we measure how far off the predictions are on test data from what the following week's flu occurrences really were?
</p>
<p id="real-world-data-projects" class="instructions">
If you want to work on the question of whether the weather partially helps predict flu cases in the following week
then there are many things to try to enhance 
this <a href="../snap/snap.html?project=weather data&editMode" target="_blank">first draft of such a project</a>.
Perhaps you can improve it with more or different data.
Or designing a different machine learning model and training scheme.
Or if start to get good predictions then see if a simpler model works almost as well.
Maybe the precipitation measurements don't matter.
Or maybe it doesn't need the full daily measurements of the previous week.
Alternatively, try doing something similar with other available datasets.

You might want to try this on your own before reading this.

<span class="advanced-topic-body">
<p class="instructions">
This <a href="../snap/snap.html?project=tic tac toe machine learning&editMode" target="_blank">Snap! program</a>
has a variable called <i>Players</i> whose value is a list of two player types.
A player type can be 'human', 'random', or the name of a model you created.
Games are recorded and are the basis for training. 
The space bar will start a new game and if humans aren't playing a new game will start as soon as a game is over.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
There is a supporting web page that allows you to experiment with training and provides a way to save and load models and game data.
Use the <span class="block-name">open support panel tensorflow.js</span> block to open up this page.
It will have a 'return to Snap!' button.
</p>
<p class="how-it-works">
The core idea is that the board positions are recorded after each move.
When a game ends then outcomes are associated with each move.
If the game ended in a tied the outcome is 0.
If the move led to a win then 1, otherwise -1.
The model is trained to predict a value between -1 and 1 for moves that may or may not be games it has been trained on.
</p>
<p class="how-it-works">
Neural nets work only with numbers so we need to decide how a board position will be represented with numbers.
A straight forward way would be to use a vector of nine numbers for each board position.
0 could mean empty, 1 X has moved there, and 2 O has.
This works but not as well as the following scheme.
The problem is that by mixing things of different kinds (moves and non-moves) the relationships between boards is hard to discern.
For example, the difference between the upper left corner having O instead of X is 1 but so is
the difference between that position being empty and having an X.
And why should the difference between an empty square and an O be twice the difference between an empty square and an X?
So to avoid this problem machine learning programs typically use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot" target="_blank">one hot</a>
vectors that are all zeros except for a single one.
So X can be &lt;1,0,0&gt;, O can be &lt;0,1,0&gt;, and empty can be &lt;0,0,1&gt;.
While a board could then be 9x3 (or 3x9) matrix it is easier to flatten the structure so that every board 
is a vector of 27 zeros and ones.

<p class="how-it-works">
Once a model has been trained the predictions for each possible move can be computed.
There are at least two ways use these predictions to make moves:
</p>
<ol class="how-it-works">
<li>
<b>Pick the largest one.</b>
The idea is that if the model is correct this move has the highest chance of leading to a win.
Note this isn't so good when the model is playing itself or another model that is also using the top predictions
since the same moves will be made over and over again and not much can be learned.
</li>
<li>
<b>Convert the predictions into probabilities.</b>
This can be done by dividing each positive prediction by the sum of all the positive predictions.
(Recall that negative predictions are predictions of moves leading to a loss.)
Then we use Snap!'s <span class="block-name">pick random ...</span> block to pick a random number.
And then we use that number to ensure that the odds of any move being chosen is determined by its probability.
</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="background-information-white" id="tic-tac-toe-training-strategies">Strategies for training a good Tic Tac Toe player</h4>
<p class="background-information">
The best advice is to experiment!
No one knows what is the best model architecture, the best way to generate good training data, how much training is required, etc.
One way to search for a good architecture is to create two models with a different number of layers or differences in the sizes of their layers.
After training them both with the same data have them play a large number of games and see if one wins more than another.
Keep the good one.
(You can save models after running the <span class="block-name">open support panel tensorflow.js</span> block.)
Repeat with a different model architecture for the weaker player.
Similarly, you can explore different training parameters to see which optimizer or learning rate works best.
Try to discover the number of learning steps after which very little progress is made in reducing the loss so you don't waste time.
One way to detect if a model benefits from additional training is to have an older version play against a newer version of the same model.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
You can do all these experiments using the Snap! program but it takes several seconds to run a game.
For running many large-scale experiments we provide this <a href="../tic-tac-toe/" target="_blank">
web page for Tic Tac Toe machine learning</a>.
It can run thousands of games in a few seconds for evaluating models or generating lots of training data.
Note that you can save a model created in Snap! and then load it into the Tic Tac Toe page and vice versa.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
Not all training data is equally useful.
Probably the least useful is random move player against random move player.
But it is easiest to generate.
A human playing another human is likely to produce very good data.
One way to generate lots of good data is to create a Snap! script for an expert player and use records of its games for training.
</p>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="hyperparameters">Automating the search for good "hyperparameters"</h4>
<p class="background-information">
It is hard to know what parameters to use to define a neural net model and its training.
How many layers?
How many neurons per layer?
How many training steps?
How large should each training step be?
Which activation and loss functions to use?
What is the best optimization method?
</p>
<p class="background-information">
One can run lots of experiments to find better and better answers to these questions.
The answers are called "hyperparameters" because they are not the weights/parameters of the neural net
but instead control how those weights are determined.
Recently researchers have begun to write programs that automate this search for good hyperparameters.
This is often called AutoML, short for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning" target="_blank">automated machine learning</a>.
These programs can search for hyperparameters that make the best quality predictions or classifications
or hyperparameters that are small and fast but still pretty accurate.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
The <span class="block-name">Search for good neural net model parameters</span> block can be used to search
for hyperparameters that minimize the "loss" (make better predictions).
You can control how many experiments it should run.
Explore the following to see how well a model can be trained to estimate the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle.

<h4 class="project-ideas-white" id="project-ideas">Possible project ideas using machine learning</h4>
<p class="project-ideas">
Here are some project ideas:
</p>
<ol class="project-ideas">
<li>
Apply machine learning to games other than Tic Tac Toe.
Simple games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes" target="_blank">dots and boxes</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank">Nim</a>
could be approached in a manner similar to the Tic Tac Toe machine learning program.
</li>
<li>
Enhance the Tic Tac Toe program include a perfect computer player that can generate good training data.
</li>
<li>
Explore how simple models can solve simple mathematical challenges (e.g. doubling a number)
and how complex models need to be to handle more complex problems like square root.
</li>
<li>
Find one or two data sources
(perhaps among these
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/02/26/big-data-and-ai-30-amazing-and-free-public-data-sources-for-2018/" target="_blank">
30 data sources</a> or using the <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch" target="_blank">Google dataset search</a> tool) 
and solve a real-world problem.
For example, maybe a machine learning program can predict how a rainy day will affect automobile traffic,
the number of people who get the flu a few days later, or the number of bicycle accidents.
Or try enhancing <a href="#real-world-data-projects">the sample flu prediction project</a>.
</li>
<li>
Use <a href="chapter-5.html">word embeddings</a> to do machine learning on texts.
For example, one can do
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis" target="_blank">sentiment analysis</a> of sentences by
converting input sentences to the average of the embeddings of its words.
The output could be a few numbers capturing the emotional content of the input sentences (e.g. angry, happy, excited).
</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="guide-to-guide-white" id="future-directions">Future directions for this chapter</h4>
<p class="guide-to-guide">
Several enhancements to this chapter are being considered.
There are many model architectures that cannot be expressed.
Convolutional networks are very successful at handling image and sound input.
Recursive neural nets handle well time-based data.
Reinforcement learning enables unsupervised learning (using only input datasets and in-world or in-simulation rewards).
