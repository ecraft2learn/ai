<h3 class="background-information-white">Introduction</h3>
<p class="background-information">
In previous chapters you used blocks that relied upon pre-trained machine learning models.
In some cases using transfer learning you were able to extend the models a little.
In this chapter we introduce blocks that enable you to create deep machine learning models from scratch,
train them, and use their predictions in your projects.
We have yet to include support for models that use images or sounds but there is a good deal one can do with numbers.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
One can build models that learn about real-world data such as weather, traffic, astronomy, economics, politics, 
and any of the many other
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/02/26/big-data-and-ai-30-amazing-and-free-public-data-sources-for-2018/" target="_blank">
open data sources</a>.
You can build models that will try to guess the next number in a sequence.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
As we explore later in this chapter one can <a href="#tic-tac-toe">create intelligent game playing programs</a>
using these machine learning blocks.
The trick is to turn game boards/positions into a list of numbers and the game outcome into a number
so the model can be trained on previous games.
</p>
<h3 class="instructions-white">How to Use Machine Learning Blocks</h3>
<p class="instructions">
To create and use a machine learning model you need these components:
</p>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>
Create a model with the desired number and size of layers.
The model will connect the input to the first layer, the first layer to second layer,
and so on until the last layer with is the output of the model.
More layers and wider layers typically makes the model more accurate but also slower to train and use.
</li>
<li>
Provide the data as two lists.
The elements of the first list are the input and the second list contains the corresponding outputs.
</li>
<li>
Train the model.
You can control how much learning it does on each step and how many steps it should run.
Very many small steps usually works best but can take a very long time.
</li>
<li>
Use the model to make predictions.
This can be done with test data where the outputs are known to evaluate the model.
And once it passes your tests you can use to predict things about the world, solve mathematics puzzles, or play games.
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="instructions-white">An example: Training a model to estimate square roots</h3>
<p class="instructions">
In the following you can use the <span class="block-name">Create a neural net model ...</span>
block to create a model with four "hidden" layers.
(Hidden in that they are inbetween the input and the output.)
You then use the <span class="block-name">Send training data ...</span>
block to set the training data to ten numbers and their square roots.
Next you can use the <span class-"block-name">Train model named ...</span> block to train the model. 
This can take several seconds and you should finally see the remaining "error" and how long it took.
Smaller errors are better.
Finally you can use the <span class="block-name">Get predictions from model ...</span> block
(the version that gets only one prediction at a time)
to test how well the model has learned.

</figure>
<p class="instructions">
We suggest you first experiment with what are called the <i>hyperparameters</i> such as
the number and size of the layers, the optimizer, learning rate, and number of learning steps.
Then see if you can make a model that computes a different function.
E.g. conversion from Centigrade to Fahrenheit.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
The machine learning blocks are not restricted to learning how to map one input number to an output number.
A simple example is
<a href="/ai/snap/snap.html?project=predict%20sequence&editMode" target="_blank">
a model that estimates the distance a point is from the origin</a>.
Given values for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> it estimates the square root of the sum of the squares of each.
