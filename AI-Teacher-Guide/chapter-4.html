<h2>A teacher's guide to helping students build AI apps and artefacts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 4 - Machine Learning</h3>
<h4>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</h4>
<h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
<p>This chapter of the guide includes many interactive elements that currently only run well in the Chrome browser.
This chapter relies upon there being a camera that the browser can access.
Note that the blocks described here create a second browser tab for "training" the system.
The first time the "Train using camera ..." block is run you may see it blocked as a "popup".
See the <a href="troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a>
for how to handle this or if other problems are encountered.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
In the previous chapters the new Snap! blocks used services that had been trained to
recognise speech and images.
In this chapter the students train the system.
This training is done by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> system.
Deep learning is a very successful set of machine learning techniques.
Here is a very nice 5 minute video that introduces the big ideas behind machine learning:

<p>
In this chapter we focus upon "supervised learning" which means that during training labels
for the input are provided.
The machine learns to then choose among training labels when presented with a new image (or other kind of input).
Rarely is the system completely confident that its choice of label is correct so instead it computes
"confidence scores".
The scores are between 0 (sure it is not this label) to 1 (sure).
The sum of the scores of all the labels always adds up to 1.
Students may prefer to display confidence scores as percentages.
For example, a .8 score for label X can be thought of as saying the system is
"80% sure the new input should have label X".

Unlike the previous chapters that rely upon pre-trained models here students can experiment with machine learning.
They can learn what kinds of inputs the system can easily tell apart and which ones confuse it.
Students can experiment to answer questions such as
how many examples of each label are needed to recognise them reliably and
how does recognition degrade as more labels are introduced.
