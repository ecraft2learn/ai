<h2>A teacher's guide to helping students build AI apps and artefacts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 4 - Machine Learning</h3>
<h4>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</h4>
<h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
<p>This chapter of the guide includes many interactive elements that currently only run well in the Chrome browser.
This chapter relies upon there being a camera that the browser can access.
Note that the blocks described here create a second browser tab for "training" the system.
The first time the "Train using camera ..." block is run you may see it blocked as a "popup".

<figcaption>The first time a training window is created it will be treated as a blocked 'popup'</figcaption></figure>

<p>
To fix the problem click the tiny icon that shows a page with a red box containing a white 'x' and
select 'Always allow popups from ...'.

<p>After allowing popups you may need to refresh the page.

<p>
There is a <a href="troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a>
that should be consulted if problems are encountered.</p>

<p>This chapter will be written soon. It will include this nice video.</p>
