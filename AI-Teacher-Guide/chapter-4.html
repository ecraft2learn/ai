<h4 class="guide-to-guide-white" id="browser-compatibility">Browser compatibility</h4>
<p class="guide-to-guide">
This chapter of the guide includes many interactive elements that currently only run well in the Chrome browser.
This chapter relies upon there being a camera that the browser can access.
Note that the blocks described here create a second browser window for "training" the system.
Snap! and training window are both in the same browser tab but only one is visible at any time.
</p>
<h4 class="background-information-white" id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p class="background-information">
In the previous chapters the new Snap! blocks used services that had been trained to
recognise speech and images.
In this chapter you do the training.
This training is done by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> system.
Deep learning is a very successful set of machine learning techniques.
It is called "deep" because there are many layers of simulated neurons that do the processing.
Typically, the lowest layers pay attention to tiny details
but higher layers can use the output of lower layers that capture some aspect of the image such as texture or edges.
Here is a very nice 5-minute video that introduces the big ideas behind machine learning:
</p>

<iframe class="background-information-white"

        style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;"

        frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

<p class="background-information">
In this chapter we focus upon "supervised learning" which means that during training labels
for the input are provided.
The machine learns to then choose among training labels when presented with a new image (or other kinds of input).
Rarely is the system completely confident that its choice of label is correct so instead it computes
"confidence scores".
The scores are between 0 (certain it is not this label) to 1 (certain it is).
The sum of the scores of all the labels always adds up to 1.
You may prefer to display confidence scores as percentages by multiplying the scores by 100.
For example, a .8 score for label X can be thought of as saying the system is
"80% sure the new input should have label X".
</p>
<p class="background-information">
Unlike the previous chapters that rely upon pre-trained models here you can experiment with machine learning.
You can learn what kinds of inputs the system can easily tell apart and which ones confuse it.
You can experiment to answer questions such as
how many examples of each label are needed to recognise them reliably and
how does recognition degrade as more labels are introduced.
In <a href="chapter-6.html">a later chapter</a> you can not only train a neural network model but
also design and create the model.
</p>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="camera-training">A block to start training to recognise images from a camera</h4>
<p class="instructions">
The <span class="block-name">Train with image buckets ...</span> block
opens a tab where you can train the system to label what is in front of the camera.
(If the tab is blocked by your browser read
the <a href="troubleshooting.html#train-camera" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a>.)
The first argument is the list of labels.
A <span class="notranslate" translate=no>"bucket"</span> is the collection of all the images with the same label.
The system will attempt to determine the confidence that an image matches the images in each bucket.
If you are training it to distinguish between two things (e.g. cats and dogs) then it is a good idea
to add a third bucket for "everything else".
During training then produce images of lots of different things that aren't cats or dogs while pressing the
button to train for the "everything else" bucket.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
This block does the training completely on your device.
There are no privacy issues that arise when relying upon third-party cloud services.
It also means this and associated blocks will work even when there is no Internet.
(See <a href="./localhost.html">instructions for how to download everything</a> and then run offline.)
Blocks that use your trained model will typically run much faster than a request over the internet to a web service,
enabling more reponsive apps.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
In the following example there are only two labels: "leaning to the left" and "leaning to the right".
You can edit the list to instead recognise different facial expressions, different people's faces,
objects held in front of the camera, and much more.
When the training tab launches you'll see two buttons:
</p>

<p class="advanced-topic">Click to read an advanced topic</p>
<span class="advanced-topic-body">
<p class="instructions">
The <span class="block-name">Train with image buckets ...</span> block only needs the first argument telling it the bucket labels.
It has three additional optional arguments:
</p>
<ol class="instructions">
<li>
Whether to start fresh or continue with the current training if this block is run more than once in a session.
</li>
<li>
Text that will appear on the training page. Can be in HTML format.
</li>
<li>
Blocks to run after returning from the training tab.
</li>
</ol>
</span>

<p class="instructions">
When training the system try to provide a variety of images that match the label.
If you are training "leaning left" then lean different amounts and at different distances to the camera.
Then when training "leaning right" don't allow the system to learn some difference that shouldn't matter.
For example, don't change the lighting or background between training different labels.
When you aren't pressing any training buttons the training page keeps
trying to recognise what is in front of the camera.
You can determine if your training is good by leaning one way and then the other
and see if the confidence scores changes as they should.
If not try adding more images.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
When you are ready to test the trained system return to the Snap! tab
and click on the blocks that contain the <span class="block-name">label confidence scores from costume</span> block.
You will see the value reported which is a list of the probability of the first label ("leaning to the left" here)
followed by the probability of the second label.
Change what is in front of the camera and try again.
Note that you can return to the training tab to add more training samples by clicking on the
<span class="block-name">Open support panel</span> block.
When you are finished with this close the training tab.
</p>
<h4 class="sample-program-white" id="training-with-image-labels">A sample program training and using image labels</h4>
<p class="sample-program">
Here is a program that launches a training tab to determine
whether your finger is pointing at the camera or to the right.
While training move your hand around so it is trained to ignore where the hand is
and just pay attention to which way the finger is pointing.
When you return to Snap! the program will repeatedly check which way your finger is pointing.
If it sees a finger pointing at the camera, then the sprite displaying the latest camera image moves forward.
If not, then it rotates.
It always displays the latest confidence scores.
</p>
<p class="exercise">
<b>Exercise.</b>
There are many ways of enhancing this program.
Add a third or fourth label and use that label to control the turtle.
For example, add the label of pointing left and change the program to turn left or right depending on which way the finger is pointing.
Or add a gesture to stop moving.
</p>
<p class="sample-program">
A full screen version of the following program can be
<a href="../snap/snap.html?project=follow%20finger" target="_blank">found here</a>.
Look at the script, it isn't very complicated considering what it does.
There is a similar <a href="../snap/snap.html?project=follow%20lean" target="_blank">
program where the sprite moves left or right depending upon which way you are leaning</a>.
Think of modifying it in interesting ways, e.g. a face whose eyes look left and right as you lean left and right.
A <a href="https://charliegerard.github.io/teachable-keyboard/training.html" target="_blank">
web page where one can type by moving one's head</a> (perhaps useful to those with physical disabilities) 
uses the same ideas as this.

<p class="exercise">
<b>Exercise.</b> Explore how to make the training more accurate.
How does the performance change as more examples are presented?
Does it help to simplify the images
(e.g. arrange so only your pointing hand with a neutral background is being captured by the camera)?
If you train with one person and then replace with another does the system get confused?
Does it help to train with both people?
</p>

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="using-costumes">Using sprite costumes instead of the camera in training</h4>
<p class="instructions">
In Snap! each sprite can have any number of "costumes".
Costumes can be drawings, photos, or imported images.

<figcaption>Snap! interface for creating costumes</figcaption></figure>

<p class="instructions">
Using the <span class="block-name">Train with all my costumes</span> you can send all of a
sprite's costumes to the training tab.
This block is defined using the <span class="block-name">Add costume &lt;i&gt; to training ...</span> block.
You can also ask the training tab about label confidences of a costume using 
<span class="block-name">Label confidences of costume ...</span>.
Note that the <span class="block-name">Prepare for training images ...</span> block is a
simple verison of <span class="block-name">Train with image buckets...</span> block
that avoids displaying the camera training window.
You can experiment with these costume-based training blocks in the following.

introduce the process of training a model to categorise images, sounds, and poses.
After training you can export your model to their server or download the files to your own web server.
The <span class="block-name">Get prediction for costume ...</span> block reports the probabilities that the costume
is in each of the categories for which it was trained.
Note that while this block can use Teachable Machine <i>pose</i> as well as those trained on <i>images</i>,
there is currently a mismatched version problem that causes errors.

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="image-recognition-without-cloud-services">Recognising images without training or cloud services</h4>
<p class="instructions">
In the <a href="chapter-3.html">previous chapter</a> many blocks were introduced that do image recognition.
These rely upon AI cloud services from large companies.
Here we instead rely upon a trained machine learning model named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861" target="_blank">MobileNet</a>.
This model runs in your browser and does not contact any cloud services.
While it will choose from among
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/imagenet_classes.ts" target="_blank">1000 labels</a>
it rarely does as well as the cloud services.
For contexts where registering for <a href="../AI-Teacher-Guide/chapter-3.html#api-keys">API keys</a> is a problem, or
Internet access is limited or missing, or privacy is a concern then models like MobileNet are useful.
It does, however, rely upon your device having a <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html" target="_blank">GPU</a>
to run at reasonable speeds.
Note this will be slow to load but should run quickly thereafter.

<h4 class="societal-impact-white" id="benefits-and-risks">Benefits and risks</h4>
<p class="societal-impact">
Most of the <a class="guide-link" href="chapter-3.html#image-recognition-good-for" target="_blank">
things image recognition is good for</a>
and <a class="guide-link" href="chapter-3.html#image-recognition-dangers" target="_blank">its dangers</a>
were discussed in chapter 3.
But maybe the situation is different
if users do the training instead of professionals in large corporations.
Will the biases be different?
Does the smaller training set make the system less reliable?

<h4 class="how-it-works-white">How does this work?</h4>
<p class="advanced-topic">Click to read an advanced topic</p>
<span class="advanced-topic-body">
<p class="how-it-works">
We discussed <a class="guide-link" href="chapter-3.html#how-does-computer-vision-work" target="_blank">
how image recognition works in general</a> in the previous chapter.
The fact that training of a deep learning system is feasible inside of browser is due to the work on
<a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">tensorflow.js</a>.
This JavaScript library speeds up learning and prediction by using the 
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html" target="_blank">GPU</a>
that is part of nearly all computers.
The GPU can be more than one hundred times faster at the computations that deep learning needs than using
the CPU of the computer.
The training window is based upon the <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachable-machine-boilerplate"
target="_blank">teachable machine boilerplate</a>.
The deep learning model used is called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861" target="_blank">MobileNet</a>
and it is designed to be smaller and faster than more accurate architectures.
It works by using MobileNet to compute 1000 numbers for each trained image.
These numbers capture high-level feature of the image.
Then when asked to classify a new image it sees which of the images used in training are the closest and
reports a high confidence for the labels of those images.
</p>
</span>

<h4 class="sample-program-white" id="rock-paper-scissors">A <i>Rock Paper Scissors</i> game using Machine Learning</h4>
<p class="sample-program">
Using machine learning one can make a <i>rock paper scissors</i> game that can be played
by putting your hand into one of three configurations.
If the game below doesn't work visit this <a href="#browser-compatibility">help</a>.
</p>

<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "rock paper scissors"
        full_screen = "true"
        container_style = "width: 800px; height: 600px" 
        caption = "Click the green flag to play Rock Paper Scissors using just your hand. TRY IT!">
</figure>

<p class="how-it-works">
This game uses the <span class="block-name">train with all my costumes ...</span> block four times.
Once for rocks, paper, and scissors and a fourth time for "other".
Once the training is completed the game starts and the program picks a random move
and compares it to what it thinks your move was based upon the analysis 
of what is in front of the camera.
You can start exploring and enhancing the game most easily by clicking on the
<span class="block-name">Open this in a new tab</span> block in the scripting area.
This example was inspired by the great set of machine learning project examples at
<a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets" target="_blank">machine learning for kids</a>
</p>

<h4 class="background-information-white" id="need-for-big-data">Doesn't machine learning require huge amounts of data?</h4>
<p class="background-information">
Much of the current success of machine learning system is a result of having trained them on <i>huge</i> data sets.
Deep learning for machine translation, for example, didn't work well until they were trained with billions of sentences.
So how could the examples in this chapter work with just dozens of examples for each label?
Part of the answer is that big data is necessary for high accuracy.
If you try the rock paper scissors game, you'll see it sometimes makes mistakes.
See if you can improve its accuracy by adding more training images.
</p>
<p class="background-information non-essential">
The image training command relies upon a deep learning model called
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861" target="_blank">MobileNet</a>
that was trained on 1000 categories in 1.2 million images.
The Snap! command uses what is called
<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/" target="_blank">transfer learning</a>
to start the training using the features that a well-trained system has already learned.
The system does not know anything about, for example, hands shaped as paper, rock, or scissors
but it has already learned about textures, edges, colours, and more.
Each training image used in transfer learning is
<a href="chapter-5.html#image_embeddings">converted by MobileNet into a list of 1280 numbers</a>.
The confidence scores for the labels is then computed using an algorithm called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm" target="_blank">k-nearest neighbors</a>.
To classify an image, its distance to each of the training images is computed and the "k" closest images are found.
These closest images "vote" for their label as the classification and the sums are used to compute the confidences. 
</p>
<p class="background-information">
Another difference is that the image recognition services in the 
<a href="chapter-3.html" target="_blank">previous chapter</a> can distinguish between many thousands of different kinds of images
and has been trained for a long time on many millions of images.
The <i>Rock paper scissors</i> game requires only four categories - an easier task.
And AI vision services can do more than just
<a href="chapter-3.html#advanced-image-recognition" target="_blank">choose a label</a> for an image.
</p>

<h4 class="background-information-white" id="recognising-sounds">Recognising sounds</h4>
<p class="background-information">
Computers can be trained to distinguish different sounds including spoken speech.
<a href="chapter-2.html">Chapter 3</a> describes how to use cloud services that do speech recognition.
Here you can create programs that respond to any sound.
Also you can train it to recognise a few different words or phrases that works locally on your computer without sending
any audio to a cloud server.
This is useful in contexts without a reliable network connection or for increased privacy.
Furthermore, the <span class="block-name">Audio label confidences</span> block has an option to use a 
"Pre-trained model of 20 words" on your device.
It is capable of recognising 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine',
'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'go', 'stop', 'yes', and 'no'.
This relies upon the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/speech-commands" target="_blank">
speech command recognizer</a> created by Google.

Google Creative Lab released browser-based software called <i>Posenet</i> for
<a href="https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5" target="_blank">
real-time human pose estimation</a>.
This software can determine the locations of 17 different face and body parts:
noses, eyes, ears, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.
Posenet was created using deep machine learning and makes use of<a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Tensorflow.js</a>.
Many are familiar with how pose detection can be embedded in video games via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Microsoft's Xbox Kinect</a>.
What is so impressive about Posenet is that it works in the browser without any special software or hardware (other than a webcam).
</p>
<p class="instructions">
The <span class="block-name">poses</span> block reports a list of poses.
One pose for each person in front of the camera.
The system can be configured on the "poses" tab to be optimised for scenes with more than one person.
Trade-offs between speed and accuracy can also be made.
The "poses" tab is also a good place to explore pose detection.
There are two kinds of <span class="block-name">pose property</span> blocks that can fetch information for a <i>pose</i>.
They both can specify that one wants the confidence the system has that it has correctly identified a particular body part
(values between 0 and 100).
Or that the location of the body part is desired which is reported as a list of the x and y coordinates.
Depending upon the value of the flag the location is reported either as values between 0 and 100 or as coordinates of the stage.
Note that because Posenet displays the video in a mirror-like fashion left and right are from the camera's viewpoint
not the person whose pose is being analysed.

<span class="advanced-topic-body">
<p class="how-it-works">
Google trained a deep learning model on over 64,000 images of people.
Associated with each image was a mask showing which pixels were of a person (indicated by one or white) or not (zero or black).
Also the locations of up to 17 face and body key points were provided.
The trained model starts by first identifying the locations of body parts in a new image. 
It then refines their positions by considering neighbouring key points (e.g. left elbow connects only with left wrist and left shoulder).
If the image is of more than one person, the model needs to separate the key points to different people. 
The algorithm starts with the key point it has the most confidence rather than a favoured starting point such as the nose.
It then considers body part locations connected to that key point, and then those connected to those parts, and so on.
If, in addition, <a href="#segmentation">segmentation</a> is also required it assigns each pixel a code for each body part it belongs.

<p class="background-information">
<a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix" target="_blank">BodyPix</a>
is a deep learning segmentation model that classifies each pixel in a photo
of people as to whether it is a part of body and if so what part.
This is called segmentation since it segments the image into hands, arms, legs, etc.

<b>color mappings</b> if provided is a list of 24 lists indicating which colour to use for each body part.
Each colour is a list of four numbers between 0 and 255 which specify the amount of red, green, blue, and opaqueness of the colours.
The order of the elements is left face, right face, left upper arm front, left upper arm back, right upper arm front,

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="style-transfer">Creating images in the style of famous paintings</h4>
<p class="instructions">
Recently researchers have invented a way to use two machine learning programs to take an image and turn it into one that 
looks like a famous painting.
This is called <a href="https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/artistic-style-transfer-with-convolutional-neural-network-7ce2476039fd" target="_blank">style transfer</a>.
The <span class="block-name">Create costume in style ...</span> block takes in a Snap! sprite costume
(that can be any image or captured from the camera) and a style name and produces a new costume in that style.

<h4 class="how-it-works-white" id="how-style-transfer-works">How style transfer works</h4>
<p class="how-it-works">
The <span class="block-name">Create costume in style ...</span> block relies upon the work done by
<a href="https://ml5js.org/docs/StyleTransfer" target="_blank">students at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts</a>
who created web-based versions of style transfer models.
Adapting it to work with Snap! was done by a high school student named Luie.
The core idea is to use a deep learning model that can recognise images to generate a new image that
matches well the low-level style features of the style image and at the same time matches the
high-level content features of a content image.
A machine learning model has been trained to do this quickly.
</p>
<p class="how-it-works">
A very good short video explaining how style transfer works is here:

<h4 class="project-ideas-white" id="project-ideas">Possible project ideas using machine learning</h4>
<p class="project-ideas">
Most of the <a class="guide-link" href="chapter-3.html#project-ideas" target="_blank">project ideas listed for using image recognition services</a>
can be based upon the blocks described in this chapter.
There is much that training by users enables that cloud services can't do.
You can train the system to recognise yourself, distinguish between your friends,
gestures, and the things that
your robots may encounter in their particular environments.
</p>
<p class="project-ideas">
Here are some project ideas that exploit the ability of users to train the system:
</p>
<ul class="project-ideas">
<li>
A different <i>Rock paper scissors</i> game would be one that is trained watching two human players.
It can then keep score as people play the game.
</li>
<li>
Yet another different <i>Rock paper scissors</i> game could learn patterns in how a human
player plays and predict what they will do next with better than chance (1/3 accuracy).
</li>
<li>
A scientific classification app.
It could be trained to tell the name of a plant when shown one of its leaves,
or identify insects, rocks, etc.
</li>
<li>
An app that can tell a healthy plant from a sick or thirsty one.
Or maybe one that can distinguish good bacteria from bad in water based on microscope images.
</li>
<li>
Identifying different sounds. Train the system to identify what musical instrument is being played.
Or which bird is singing.
Or identify who is speaking.
Or whether the tone of the voice is happy, sad, or angry.
</li>
<li>
A robot that recognises gestures such as "stop" when it sees an outstretched palm.
</li>
<li>
Control a game element with four hand positions for left, right, up, and down.
Maybe left and right could be pointing left or right, up could be thumbs up, and down thumbs down.
Create your own game, modify <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/explore">one already in Snap!</a>,
or <a href="https://djdolphin.github.io/Snapin8r2/" target="_blank">import a Scratch game</a>.
This idea was inspired by this
<a href="https://medium.com/@mariannelinharesm/playing-a-game-using-just-your-camera-with-deeplearnjs-ca156008f537" target="_blank">
article about using hand gestures to play Tetris, Snake, and Asteroids</a>.
Or use the player's head orientation instead of hand positions.
To try playing a PacMan game with just your head visit
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-examples/webcam-transfer-learning/dist/index.html" target="_blank">Webcam PacMan</a>).
What could be used for "mouse click"?
Who might want to use such a system that relied upon head movements?
</li>
<li>
A program that greets fellow students by name when they sit in front of the camera.
</li>
<li>
A safety app that can tell if someone is lying on the floor or not.
If someone is down for <i>x</i> minutes it contacts help.
Or an app that can tell if a bed is empty or not and takes some action if the bed is occupied well after
the time the occupant usually gets up.
</li>
<li>A sorting robot that is trained to distinguish a small number of different kinds of things.
It then moves the items into piles for each kind of thing.
</li>
<li>
And thousands more. Be creative.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="project-ideas">
Many projects are possible by using the pose detection block, the segmentation block, and the style transfer block:
</p>
<ul class="project-ideas">
<li id="simon-says-enhancements">
There are many improvements one can make to the <a href="#simon-says-game"><i>Simon Says</i></a> game.
The nose is the only recognised body part that doesn't have a left and right version, try to add it to the game.
Occasionally the game will say something like "touch your right wrist to your right wrist"; see if you can avoid that.
Add score keeping.
The game can be tuned to use better values for how close two body parts need to be to be touching.
Or tune the minimal confidence used produce the list of body parts.
The game gives players a limited amount of time to comply with instructions, try speeding up the game as it goes on.
Maybe as it gets faster make the <a href="chapter-1.html" target="_blank">speech synthesis</a> go faster as well.
Add to the display of what the camera sees markers on the body parts that are to touch.
If you are also doing a robotics project how can you combine it with this game?
Think up even more ways to make the game better.
</li>
<li>
Use body poses as program commands.
E.g. hands over your head means stop while arms down means to continue.
</li>
<li>
During an epidemic (such as Covid-19) people were advised not to touch their face.
Using the <span class="block-name">poses</span> block see if you can make an app that will notify people when they touch their face.
Or enhance this <a href="/ai/snap/snap.html?project=dont%20touch%20your%20face" target="_blank">Don't touch your face project</a>
by improving the graphics, adding sound effects, tuning the parameters, adding a video feed,
<a href="chapter-1.html">responding with speech</a>,
adjusting for distance to camera or more.
</li>
<li>
Display a pair of eyes that moves to the left or right as you do.
</li>
<li>
Implement a paper doll puppet that moves its arms and legs in the same way as the poses are reported using the camera.
</li>
<li>
Change an image as one moves closer or further from the camera.
Maybe make text get larger as one moves further away.
Hint: using Posenet one can measure how far apart someone's eyes seem to be.
</li>
<li>
Create a program that figures out how far away someone is from the camera.
Hint how does the distance between the eyes change as someone moves closer?
</li>
<li>
There are many other things one can use <a href="#pose-detection">pose detection</a> for than just <i>Simon Says</i>.
Think animation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence" target="_blank">telepresence</a>,
interactive art, fitness, sport science, security, and more.
</li>
<li>
The augmented reality <a href="../index.html#balloon-game" target="_blank">Balloon Game</a> can be improved in many ways.
One idea is that additional body parts can have colours that are used in the game to determine what happens when a coloured balloon comes into contact.
</li>
<li>
Train the computer to know which part of a face is being pointed to.
Have the program do different things depending upon whether you point to your eyes, ears, or mouth.
</li>
<li>
Using the <span class="block-name">poses block</span> add some funny noses or ears to images of people. 
Run this in a forever loop to add your effects to a live video feed.
</li>
<li>
Create a virtual art museum filled with style transfer images.
The content images can come from a camera, web pages, drawings, and screenshots of programs like Google Earth or Street View.
</li>
<li>
And much more. Imagine art projects using style transfer or games using pose detection.
