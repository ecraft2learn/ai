<h2>A teacher's guide to helping students build AI apps and artefacts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2 - Speech Input</h3>
<h4>Ken Kahn, University of Oxford</h4>
<h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
<p>This guide includes many interactive elements that currently only run well in the Chrome browser.
This chapter relies upon there being a microphone connected to your computer.
(Note that when running Linux (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi)
one may need to configure the system or the browser to know how to access the microphone.)
There is a <a href="troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a>
that should be consulted if problems are encountered.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is much easier to get a computer to start with text and end up with speech
than to start with speech and end up with the corresponding text.
Often it is easier to get a computer to generate something than to recognise it.</p>

<p>Speech (and other sounds) cause vibrations in the air that cause vibrations in the computer's microphone.
These vibrations are converted to numbers.
Speech recognition begins with these numbers and attempts to determine what was said.
As you'll see the process is not perfect, mistakes occur.</p>
<h4>A simple speech recognition block</h4>
<p>Click on the following block, say something, then click on the 'last thing heard' variable.
If all is working well you should see what you just said.</p>

<h4>Speech recognition errors</h4>
<p>Speech recognition can encounter errors such as the inability to access the microphone.
The most common "error" is when after several seconds nothing is heard.
The 'listen then ...' block keeps listening until there is an error.
(Try saying something, look at the result, say something else, and look again.)
When the speech recogniser notices that nothing has been said then the error block is given the text "no-speech".
Other errors are 'audio-capture' when the browser can't find a microphone and 
'not-allowed' when permission to use the microphone hasn't been granted.
Try the following and then be quiet for a while.</p>

<h4>A sample program using speech recognition (and synthesis)</h4>
<p>The following program uses the 'listen then ...' block to control a sprite.
You can tell it to go forward or to the turn right.
It will then ask you how much and then execute the command.
Say "goodbye" to quit the program.
Sometimes you need to repeat what you said.
Occassionally it will mishear you.</p>

<p>A similar program could be written to control a physical device such as a robot or a set of lights.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/command.png" class="center">
<figcaption>Click to try the voice command example</figcaption></figure></a>

<h4>How the speech command program works</h4>
<p>If you cick on <img src="images/show-blocks.png"> you'll see the blocks behind the program.
If you then right click on 'speak turtle commands' and select 'edit' you'll see its program.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/command-program.png" class="center">
<figcaption>The blocks that implement the speech command program</figcaption></figure>

<p>The 'spoken' variable contains what was just recognised.
The nested 'if-then-else' commands test first for speech for exiting the program, then for forward movement, and then turning commands.
If none match then a 'not understood' response is created.
Both the turning and moving commands cause the program to ask for an amount to turn or move.
When a number is spoken the turtle then turns or moves appropriately.</p>

<h4>An alternative way to do the same thing</h4>
<p>The command program relies upon what computer scientists call 'continuations'.
These are blocks of code that are executed when something happens, in this case when the speech is recognised.
An alternative that is popular among Scratch programmers is to rely instead upon broadcasting messages.
The following implements voice commands by using a helper command called 'Broadcast speech recognition results and ...'.
It broadcasts the message 'heard something'.
The program fragments that listen for 'heard something' broadcasts need to know what was heard.
The variable 'last thing heard' is used for this.
(It also broadcasts speech recognition errors and sets the 'speech recognition error' if they occur.)
This style of programming is perhaps easier for young children but it does have its limitations.
For example, it is very difficult to implement a response when no other parts of the program understand what was said.
The first version responds by saying it didn't understand what was said, repeats what it thinks it heard, and says to try again.
The following version cannot do so.</p>

<h4>An example project involving generating sentences using parts of speech concepts</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=toontalk&ProjectName=part%20of%20speech%20broadcast" target="_blank">
sentence generating program</a> starts with a random sentence "template".
The program considers any word starting with "?" to be a variable that is replaced by asking the user for something of that sort.
For example,
<blockquote>The silly ?PLURAL-NOUN like ?ADJECTIVE bananas.
</blockquote>
will cause the program to first ask the user for a "plural noun" and then ask for an "adjective".
If the user answers "potatoes" and "gigantic" then the program says 
<blockquote>The silly potatoes like gigantic bananas.
</blockquote></p>

<p>Let's look at the code to see how it works.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/part-of-speech-code.png">
<figcaption>Screenshot of the core of the program that asks for substitutions for words beginning with "?"</figcaption></figure>
<p>This part of the program goes through the sentence word by word pausing when a word or phrase starts with a "?".
It pauses after asking for a substitution and then calls the 'Broadcast speech recognition results ...' command.
The following code responds when something has been heard and interpreted:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/part-of-speech-when-something-heard.png">
<figcaption>Screenshot of the part of the program that responds to recognised words or phrases</figcaption></figure>
<p>It repeats what was heard and substitutes it into the list of words replacing the word starting with "?".</p>

<p>This example illustrates how to use speech input and output to produce an application that is purely verbal.
It is also an example of a program that crosses discipline boundaries.
To generate grammatically correct (though often nonsense or silly) sentences one needs to reply upon grammatical concepts
such as nouns, noun phrases, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
Issues about number agreement and tenses arise naturally.
A student may for the first time see the <i>utility</i> of these concepts since without them the generated sentences are no good.</p>

<h4 id="story-generator">A more sophisticated sentence (or story) generator</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=toontalk&ProjectName=story%20generator" target="_blank">story generator</a> extends the sentence generator by adding a new feature.
If it encounters a word beginning with "=" it replaces it with the last response to the request for an example of that word/phrase.
For example, consider this very short story:
<blockquote>
This is a story about ?GIRLS-NAME.
=GIRLS-NAME is ?ADJECTIVE and very ?ADJECTIVE.
She travelled to ?PLACE-NAME. There she met ?BOYS-NAME who was a ?OCCUPATION in =PLACE-NAME.
=GIRLS-NAME and =BOYS-NAME lived ?ADVERB ever after.
</blockquote>
If the responses were "Juliet", "warm", "beautiful", "Verona", "Romeo", "amateur poet", and "barely" then the generated story is:
<blockquote>
This is a story about Juliet.
Juliet is warm and very beautiful.
She travelled to Verona. There she met Romeo who was a amateur poet in Verona.
Juliet and Romeo lived barely ever after.
</blockquote>
A student may want to enhance the program to turn "a amateur" into "an amateur".</p>

<h4>A question answering demo</h4>
<p>The following demo is a bit like Alexa, Cortana, and "OK Google".
It asks the user to say something and then sends those words off to Wikipedia.
Typically there are many matches so it picks on at random and says it.</p>

<h4>What is speech recognition good for?</h4>
<p>Speech recognition can be used to transcribe spoken speech.
Those unable to type or write can use it to communicate textually and to generate notes and reports.
There are many specialised contexts where it can be very useful.
For example, <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2017/11/understanding-medical-conversations.html" target="_blank">
doctors can produce transcripts of their conversations with patients</a>, thereby improving the patient's records.
Automatic transcription can enable textual searches within videos.
It can be used to generate captions for videos.
Combined with translation, speech recognition can provide input to a translation services
and its output can be converted to speech in another language.</p>

<p>Another use of speech input is as an interface to computers or digital artefacts.
An application or a robot can be constructed that takes verbal commands.
This is particularly empowering for people with disabilities who can't themselves perform those tasks.
Assistants like Siri or Alexa can provide helpful responses to spoken queries.
Verbal input and output can be the safest way to communicate in some circumstances such as when driving or piloting.</p>

<h4>What are the dangers of speech recognition?</h4>
<p>Like many technologies speech recognition can be misused.
It could be used for widespread spying on a population.
It could be part of the basis for replacing human interactions with call-centre help services with computers
that lack the kind of understanding and empathy that people can provide.
This is also an issue with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/companion-robots-are-here/" target="_blank">companion robots</a>.
It can be used to automate annoying telemarketing calls.
It could be part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/10/should-robot-be-your-childs-best-friend" target="_blank">
toys that children become too emotionally attached to</a>.</p>

<p>The benefits and dangers of speech technology could be good topic for student dicussions.</p>

<h4>How does speech recognition work?</h4>
<p>It begins with the microphone that converts vibrations in the air (i.e. sounds) to numbers
(using something called an analog-to-digital converter).
The digitised sound is broken into short segments (hundredths or thousandths of a second long) and fed into a recognition engine.
Today the best ones rely upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">neural nets</a>.
Complex statistical programs are also often used.</p>

<p>There are many challenges including the wide range of voices, dialects, and accents that a speech recognition engine may encounter.
There is often background noise that needs to be removed from the signal.</p>

<p>Other challenges come from the complexity of human languages.
There are many words that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym" target="_blank">hononyms</a>, different words that sound the same.
Separating speech into separate words is difficult.
A classic example is how "recognise speech" sounds a lot like "wreck a nice beach".</p>

<p>As one uses the blocks and sample programs of this chapter one will often encounter errors.
These are sometimes amusing, especially when it leads the program to do something silly.
For applications where computer mistakes can cause serious problems one can build the interface so it asks confirmation before proceeding.
It is interesting to compare speech recognition errors to the kind and frequency of the errors that humans make when listening to speech.</p>

<h4 id="project-ideas">Ideas for projects using speech input and output</h4>
<p>Here are some ideas for projects using speech input (and sometimes speech output as described in <a href="chapter-1.html">Chapter 1</a>).
<ul>
<li>A chatbot that can (pretend to) talk about a particular subject.
Chatbots have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">history going back over fifty years</a>
but it is only recently that speech can replace typing as the way to communicate with a chatbot.</li>
<li>Another example of a textual program that can be reconceived as a verbal program
are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Text_adventures_and_Interactive_Fiction" target="_blank">adventure games</a>.
A virtual world is simulated where one can navigate by saying things like "walk north" or "open door" and hearing responses such as 
"you now see a castle in the distance" and "the door is locked".
This can result in a computer game that blind people can play (or drivers can play without taking their eyes off the road).</li>
<li>Guessing games such as "guess what number I'm thinking of".
The computer can either pick a number and respond to guesses with "warmer" or "colder".
Or the computer can guess numbers and listen for the words "warmer" or "colder" to decide what to guess next.</li>
<li>Telling or responding to knock knock jokes.</li>
<li>An interactive artwork that responds differently depending upon if it hears is something positive or negative. 
It could do so by searching for key words and phrases in what it hears or
it could connect to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis" target="_blank">sentiment analysis</a> service.</li>
<li>Putting together two speech apps so they interact.
For example, the part-of-speech sample program described earlier could be paired with a program that searches for keywords such as
"noun", "verb", etc. and then responds with a random entry in the corresponding list.
This could be even more exciting if the two apps were placed into some physical devices that "converse".</li>
<li>And thousands of other things.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>A full-featured speech recognition block</h4>
<p>The speech recognition engines typically can do more than the basic 'listen then ...' block described above.
One can specify which language is expected.
The engine can report interim results and alternative results.
It can provide 'confidence' values indicating how certain it is that it recognised the speech correctly.
All of these functionalities are provided by this block:</p>

<figure>
<div class="iframe-container" style="width: 800px; height: 200px;">
<iframe class="iframe-clipped"
        scrolling="no"
        src="../snap/snap.html"
        project_path="../AI-teacher-guide-projects/complex listen block.xml">
</iframe></div>
<figcaption>A full-featured block for turning speech into text. TRY IT</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The arguments to this block are (any of them can be left blank):
<ol>
<li>The first argument are blocks that receive interim results as they are produced.</li>
<li>The next argument are blocks that receive the final result.</li>
<li>The next argument receives errors if there are any.</li>
<li>Text in the format language-dialect.
E.g. en-GB. It should be one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag" target="_blank">IETF language tags</a>.</li>
<li>The maximum number of alternative recognition results. If not provided it is 1. Note the recognition engine may return fewer results.</li>
<li>Blocks that receive a list of alternative results.</li>
<li>Blocks that receive a list of confidence numbers corresponding to the alternative results.
0 means no confidence while 1 is the highest confidence.</li>
</ol>
Note that for Google's speech recognition engine currently only the first alternative has a non-zero confidence.</p>

<p>Watching the interim results can provide some insight into the process of recognition.
You can test this using the above block where you put the 'say' block with an empty text field in the first argument.
(Snap! interprets an empty field in this context as the input to the blocks (in this case the current interim result).)
For example, if you say "red" you'll see "red" but if you soon afterwards say "a book" you'll see "red" become "read a book".
You can see the same phenomenon at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html" target="_blank">this Google demo</a>.</p>

<p>There is much one can explore with the 'language' option.
For example, if one selects 'fr-FR' (French as spoken in France) and then says "une deux trois quatre five six" the result is "1 2 3 4 5 6".
Notice that it recognises both French and English.
(English is probably used because it the operating system language setting on my computer --
if your computer is configured with another language it probably will be the default.)
Strangely if with English you say "one two three four five six" you get those words, not the digits one sees with the French setting.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition" target="_blank">Wikipedia, as usual, covers the topic well.</p>
