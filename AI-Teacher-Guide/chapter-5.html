<h4 class="background-information-white" id="arithmetic-with-words">Doing arithmetic with words and sentences</h4>
<p class="background-information">
While computers can deal with text as strings of characters, a technique called
<a href="https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469" target="_blank">word embedding</a>
works by converting words into a long list of numbers.
These numbers can either be created by humans where a number has a meaning such as 'minimum size', 'maximum size' or 'average life expectancy'.
Most AI programs instead use numbers created by machine learning
(see <a href="chapter4.html">the previous chapter</a> and <a href="chapter6.html">the next chapter</a>).
The numbers are created by considering text with billions word (e.g. all Wikipedia pages in a given language).
People don't understand what the numbers mean but similar words have similar numbers and unrelated words have very different numbers.
Each number measures a 'feature' of the word but what feature is a mystery.
</p>
<p class="background-information">
The word embeddings used in this chapter were created by <a href="https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/support.html" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
They trained their machine learning models on 157 different languages on all Wikipedia articles in each language.
Even though that was about a billion words each that wasn't enough,
so they also trained their models on tens of billions more words found by <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/" target="_blank">crawling the web</a>.
They created tables for each language of at least a million different words.
The blocks described here provide the 20,000 most common words for 15 languages.
(Larger tables and more languages can be added. Send requests to toontalk@gmail.com.)
</p>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="words-to-numbers">Turning a word into lots of numbers</h4>
<p class="instructions">
We have created Snap! blocks for exploring how word embeddings can be used to find similar words, 
words which are between other words, and most surprisingly solve word analogy problems.
The <span class='block-name'>features of word</span> block will report a list of 300 numbers.
If the language field is left empty, the default language will be used.
You can think of the numbers as placing the word in a 300-dimensional space.
The numbers were adjusted so all 20,000 words fit inside a 300-dimensional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere" target="_blank">hypersphere</a> with a radius of 1.
There are databases with word embeddings for one million words
but loading and searching such a large data set would be very slow.
The <span class='block-name'>features of word</span> block is based upon the most frequently occurring 20,000 entries that 
are lower case (no proper nouns) and contain only letters (no punctuation or digits).

<figure class = "snap-iframe"

</figure>

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="closest-word">Finding the closest word to a list of feature numbers</h4>
<p class="instructions">
A program can search through all the words to find the word that is closest to a list of numbers.
The <span class="block-name">closest word to</span> reporter block does this.

<h4 class="advanced-information-white" id="measuring-distance">Different ways of measuring distances in high dimensional spaces</h4>
<p class="background-information advanced-information">
There are two common ways of measuring distance in a high-dimensional space.
One is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" target="_blank">Euclidean distance</a>
which is a generalisation of how distance is computed in 2 and 3 dimensional space.
The idea is to take the sum of the squares of the differences along each of the 300 dimensions and then report the square root of that.
The other measure is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">cosine similarity</a>.
Both work pretty well in the <span class="block-name">closest word to</span> reporter which lets you choose which to use.
While they usually agree sometimes small differences can be observed.
For example, the third closest word to "dog" can be "canine" or "puppy" depending on the measure.
</p>
</span>

<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "closest word to"
        container_style = "width: 800px; height: 500px" 
        caption = "Finding the word closest to a word. TRY IT!">
</figure>
</p>

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="averaging-words">Finding the word half way between two other words</h4>
<p class="instructions">
You can take two words and average their features by adding together corresponding numbers and dividing the result by 2.
You can then use the <span class="block-name">closest word to</span> reporter to find the word closest to the average.
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "word average"
        container_style = "width: 750px; height: 300px" 
        caption = "Finding the word closest to the average of two words. TRY IT!">
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
Try averaging more than two words.
And see what word is the closest to somewhere between two words other than the halfway point.
</p>

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="word-analogy-problems">Using word embeddings to solve word analogy problems</h4>
<p class="instructions">
One of the most surprising thing about word embeddings is that with the right formula
one can solve word analogy problems.
For example, "man is to woman as king is to what?" can be expressed as "king+(woman-man)=x".
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "word analogy"
        container_style = "width: 850px; height: 550px" 
        caption = "Solving word analogy problems. TRY IT! Then find other analogies that work.">
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
Note that "king is to man as woman is to what?" can be expressed as "woman+(king-man)=x".
And "king+(woman-man)=x" and "woman+(king-man)=x" are equivalent yet they solve different word analogy problems!
This use of word embeddings works for grammatical analogies as well.
Try solving "slow is to slower as fast is to what?".
You might need to add 'fast' as an exception.
</p>
<h4 class="instructions-white" id="closest-words">Finding all the 'closest' words</h4>
<p class="instructions">
If you were to use the <span class="block-name">closest word to</span> reporter to sort all
the words by distance to a list of features, it would take about a full day since it will have
to call the reporter 20,000 times.
Instead we provide the <span class="block-name">closest words to</span> reporter that 
does it all at once in less than a second if the device has a
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html" target="_blank">GPU</a>
(except the first time it is called it may take several seconds).
Optionally it can also report the distances as cosines.
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "sort closest words"
        container_style = "width: 900px; height: 500px" 
        caption = "Find all the words closest to a word or list of features. TRY IT!">
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
While one rarely needs all 20,000 words it might be interesting to compare two words by
seeing how many of the nearest 100 or 500 words of each are in common.
Think up other uses for this reporter.
</p>

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="sentence-embeddings">Sentence embeddings</h4>
<p class="background-information">
One can compute sentence embeddings by averaging all the words in a sentence.
There is, however, a much better way that uses models that were trained to address
sentence-level tasks. 
The <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46808/" target="_blank">Universal Sentence Encoder</a> is one such model that
is available in the browser.
The reporters <span class="block-name">get features of sentence</span> and 
<span class="block-name">get features of sentences</span> use this the Universal Sentence Encoder
to produce 512 numbers for any sentence. (Really any sequence of words, it needn't be a grammatical sentence.)
</p>
<p class="background-information">
It can be used to measure how similar two sentences are.
Consider
<br>
A. How are you?
<br>
B. How old are you?
<br>
C. What is your age?
<br>
A and B have many words in common but it is B and C that have similar meanings.
</p>
<p class="instructions">
The <span class="block-name">get sentence features</span> block accepts multi-word texts and
reports a list of 512 numbers.
To compare sentences we use 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">cosine similarity</a>
that usually works better than Euclidean distance.
(The JavaScript version is used because it is faster.)
Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions" target="_blank">arc cosine</a>
converts the cosine similarity to an angle for clarity.

        caption = "Here's a way to compare sentences. TRY IT!">
</figure>
<p class="background-information" id="confidence-guesser">
Sentence encodings can be used for more than comparing sentences.
Combined with deep learning models (see the <a href="chapter-6.html"> chapter on creating, training, and using machine learning models</a>)
they can be used to train a system to detect sentiment, emotions, topics, and more.

<h4 class="background-information-white" id="to-2d-points">Mapping 300 dimensional points to two-dimensional points</h4>
<p class="background-information">
No one can visualise 300-dimensional space.
There are techniques for giving an impression of the relationships between very high-dimensional points
by mapping the points to two or three dimensions.
We use a technique called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding" target="_blank">t-SNE</a>.
It can be understood as a physics simulation where all points in crowded areas repel each other and
all points are attracted to those with a small distance away (in high-dimensional space).

<h4 class="societal-impact-white" id="benefits-and-risks">Benefits and risks using word embeddings</h4>
<p class="societal-impact">
Word embeddings can be used as a component in AI programs that do
sentiment analysis, entity detection, recommendations, summarising text, translation, and question answering.
This is typically done by replacing the words in a text with their embeddings and then doing machine learning on the 
approximate meaning of the words.
This makes the systems work better with synonyms and paraphrasings.
</p>
<p class="societal-impact">
Word embeddings are learned by examining text with billions of words.
These texts may have captured
<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/text-embedding-models-contain-bias.html" target="_blank">
societal biases</a>.
For example, the following example seems to have captured the bias that butchers are male and bakers are female.
But the bias is so weak that if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">cosine similarity</a>
is used instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" target="_blank">Euclidean distance</a>
the unbiased "chef" is found.
Some word embedding databases have the bias that doctors are male and nurses are female.
They will answer the question "man is to doctor as woman is to X" with "nurse".
Is this a bias? Or might it be due to the fact that only women can nurse babies?
Run some experiments below to explore these kinds of questions.

A paper called <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183" target="_blank">
Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases</a>
proposed a way to measure word biases.
The idea is to use the average distance two words have to two sets of "attribute" words.
To explore gender bias, for example, the attribute word lists can be "male, man, boy" and "female, woman, girl".
The difference of the average distances provides a score that can be used to compare words.

<p class="sample-program">
<a href=""target="_blank">Codenames</a> is an award-winning board game.

<h4 class="how-it-works-white" id="how-do-word-embeddings-work">How does this work?</h4>
<p class="how-it-works">
While we don't really know what the numbers mean, they must be encoding lots of things about words such as
gender, grammatical category, family relationships, and hundreds more things.
But the numbers aren't perfect.
See if you can create some examples where the results are not good.
One known problem with how the numbers are generated is that it combines features of different senses of the same word.
There is only one entry, for example, for 'bank' which combines the ways that word is
used in sentences about financial institutions and those about the sides of rivers.
This can cause words to be closer than they should be.
For example, "rat" and "screen" end up being closer together than otherwise due to "rat" being close to "mouse"
and "mouse" (the computer input device) being close to (computer) "screen".
This is a problem researchers are working on.
Another problem is that sometimes short phrases act like words.
"Ice cream", for example, has no word embedding while "sherbet" and "sorbet" do.
</p>
<h4 class="sample-program-white" id="translation-sample-project">A sample project using word embeddings for translation</h4>
<p class="sample-program">
Here is
<a href="../snap/snap.html?project=translate&noRun" target="_blank">a program that asks the user for two languages</a>,
obtains the feature vector of a random word from the first language,
and then displays several of the words closest to that feature vector.
It places the words in the <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/" target="_blank">t-SNE</a>
two-dimensional approximation of where the 300-dimensional words really are.
</p>
<h4 class="how-it-works-white" id="how-does-translation-work">How does translation using word embeddings work?</h4>
<p class="how-it-works">
The word embeddings for each language were generated independently based upon text from Wikipedia and the web.
The location in 300-dimensional space of the features for a word like 'dog' have no relationship 
to the location of features of translations of the word 'dog'.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4168" target="_blank">Researchers</a>
noticed that in most (all?) languages some words are close together.
For example, 'dog', 'dogs', puppy', and 'canine' are close.
Words like 'wolf', 'cow', and 'mouse' are close but not as close as those words.
And all of these words are far from abstract words like 'truth' and 'logic'.
So they discovered that it is possible to find a rotation that will cause many word embeddings
in one language to cause translations of those words to be close.
The way it was done at first and in these Snap! blocks is by giving a program a word list between
English and each other language.
500 words is enough to find a good rotation that brings most of the other 19500 words
close to where their translations are.
While it is impressive that translation works at all given a word list that covers only 2.5% of the vocabulary,
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/ai-research/unsupervised-machine-translation-a-novel-approach-to-provide-fast-accurate-translations-for-more-languages/" target="_blank">
Researchers at Facebook describe a technique</a> that uses no word lists or translated texts.
A rotation is all that is needed because all the word embeddings are centred around zero
so they don't need to be translated (in the mathematical sense, i.e. moved) as well.
But note that the translation happens in 299 dimensions!

<figcaption>Two ways of aligning word embeddings in different languages</figcaption></figure>
<p class="how-it-works">
In the figure (A) and (B) show X being rotated to match Y to make a small number of words in X align with their translation in Y.
Many other words become roughly aligned as a result.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf" target="_blank">Other techniques can be applied</a> to improve the alignment.

<h4 class="instructions-white" id="image_embeddings">Image embeddings are possible as well</h4>
<p class="instructions">
Using a similar technique to how vectors are generated for words we can also generate vectors for images.
The <span class="block-name">get costume features of ...</span> block will pass
a vector of 1280 numbers to the blocks provided.
This uses MobileNet to compute the numbers from the "top" of the neural net.
</p>
<figure class = "snap-iframe"
        id = "image embedding exercise"
        container_style = "width: 675px; height: 525px" 
        caption = "A block for converting images into lists of 1280 numbers. TRY IT!">
</figure>
<p class="instructions">
One can use image embeddings to determine which images are close to other images.
Closeness takes into account many factors including texture, colour, parts, and semantics.
Image embeddings can be used to work out image analogy problems similar to how word analogy problems are solved.
</p>
<p class="how-it-works">
In the machine learning chapter there is a
<a href="chapter-4.html#image-recognition-without-cloud-services" target="_blank">description</a>
of the <span class="block-name">train with image buckets ...</span> block which is used for training.
It works by collecting the feature vectors of all the training images and then finds the nearest neighbours to 
a test image to determine what label to give the image.

<h4 class="project-ideas-white" id="project-ideas">Possible project ideas for Natural Language Processing</h4>
<p class="project-ideas">
Here are some project ideas:
</p>
<ol class="project-ideas">
<li>
Find a chain of similar words by finding the nearest word to the starting word.
Then repeatedly find the nearest word to that while making sure to never repeat the same word.
Use this to repeatedly change random words one at a time in a famous poem or text
(e.g. "roses are red and violets are blue").
</li>
<li>
Make word games using word embeddings.
For example, something like <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/semantris" target="_blank">Semantris</a>,
a semantic version of Tetris.
A bilingual version Semantris might be a good idea.
</li>
<li>
Create a program that searches for new word analogies.
Hint: If A is to B as C is to D, then A-B "is close to" C-D.
</li>
<li>
Explore why sometimes word analogies are right and sometimes wrong.
Does the second, third, or tenth closest answer make more sense?
Hint: use the <span class="block-name">closest words to</span> reporter to explore this.
Is it better at word analogies when A is close to B in "A is to B as C is to D"?
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170413141055.htm" target="_blank">Researchers have found</a>
that if you look at the average distance between pleasant words and the word 'flowers', the distance is much smaller than
the distance of 'flowers' to unpleasant words.
The opposite holds if you explore the distance of pleasant and unpleasant words to the word 'insects'.
Based upon this observation people have made other comparisons to see how, for example,
words about males are closer to words about science while words about females are closer to art words.
See if you can find other biases that arise from the way people write about things.
If you know another language (and it is one of the 15 supported languages) see if it applies across languages.
</li>
<li>
Explore the relationships between words in groups such a colour words or emotion words. 
Are 'red', 'green', and 'blue' close to each other or are colour words close when the colours appear similar.
If you know another language see if different languages organise colour words differently.
Try this with other categories such emotions, directions, numbers, etc.
</li>
<li>
Explore the relationships between different grammatical versions of the same word stem.
E.g. the relationships of 'tall', 'taller', 'tallest', 'short', 'shorter', 'shortest'.
Or 'run', 'ran', 'running' (and 'runny' and 'runnier').
Can you find some general patterns?
Do they generalise to other languages?
</li>
<li>
Implement a spymaster for the <a href="#codenames">Codenames</a> game.
</li>
<li>
Try using embeddings to explore the similarity of sentences.
Use the <span class="block-name">features of sentences ...</span> block to get the features of sentences.
Create a project that decides if two sentences are paraphrases.
</li>
<li>
Create a question answering project that checks if the question being asked if similar enough to
a known question so it can reply with a "canned" answer.
You might want to start by improving <a href="chapter-6.html#ai-questions">
the sample project that answers questions about Snap! AI blocks</a>
</li>
<li>
Using the <span class="block-name">answer this question ... using this passage ...</span> block
together with the <span class="block-name">Ask Wikipedia</span> block make a general question answering program.
Consider adding speech input and output.
</li>
<li>
Be creative! Word embeddings are new and there is much that remains to discover.
</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="background-information-white" id="future-directions">Future directions for this chapter</h4>
<p class="background-information">
New word embeddings blocks could be added.
Currently the word embeddings blocks excludes all proper nouns.
If we added them one could solve analogies such as Paris is to France as Berlin is to X.
Exploring how words change over time can lead to great projects.
<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/" target="_blank">
Word embeddings generated from publications in different time periods</a>
could be used to see how words like "awful" and "broadcast" have changed over the last two centuries.
New blocks could be added based upon research on generating
<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%22word+sense%22+embeddings&btnG=" target="_blank">
"word sense" embeddings</a>
instead of word embeddings.
E.g. one sense of "duck" is close to "chicken" while another sense is close to "jump".
</p>
<p class="background-information">
There is plenty more that AI programs can do with language including
determining the grammatical structure of sentences (this is called "parsing"),
figuring out the sentiment in some text,
and question answering.
We plan to add more.
