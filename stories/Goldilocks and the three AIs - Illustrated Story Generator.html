  <div id="content"><p class="story-paragraph">Once upon a time in a world of futuristic technology, there lived a curious girl named Goldilocks. She was known for her insatiable fascination with artificial intelligence, always seeking to understand more about these sophisticated beings. One day, while wandering through the woods, she came across a peculiar house, unlike any other she'd ever seen. The house was home to three AIs – Papa AI, Mama AI, and Baby AI – all designed to help humans in their various endeavors, but they were not home.

Goldilocks tried each chair to see which was the most comfortable, finding the small chair to be just right. As she sat, she unwittingly activated the AI's code, and the room transformed into a simulation where she could interact with the technology.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>To generate a story, enter a brief description of the story you want in the text area below, and set the desired number of paragraphs (default is 3). Then click "Generate Story." The AI will create a story with corresponding illustration descriptions for each paragraph.</p>
    <p>Once the story is generated, you can click on any paragraph to receive a list of constructive criticisms from the AI. Each criticism will appear as a button above the paragraph. Click on a criticism button to rewrite the paragraph following the chosen criticism. The criticism button will be removed after rewriting.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to provide your own criticism, click on the "Add your own criticism" button. A text input field will appear, where you can type your criticism. After entering your criticism, click "Submit," and the AI will rewrite the paragraph following your input.</p>
    <p>To close the list of criticism buttons, click on the "Close" button that appears alongside them.</p>
    <p>You can click on an image to replace it with another one. The AI will generate a new illustration based on the corresponding illustration description.</p>
