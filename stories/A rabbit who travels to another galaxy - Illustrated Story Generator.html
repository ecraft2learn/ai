Rigel was unlike any rabbit you had ever seen before – he was covered in silver fur with swirls of cosmic purple on his ears and paws. He spent his days hopping about his home planet, Oryctola, filled with lush green vegetation and rainbow-colored rivers, observing the stars above and constructing a special spaceship to take him to the unknown realms beyond the skies.
