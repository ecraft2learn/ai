<h3>Activate COVID-19 Emergency Operations Plan by:</h3>
<p>
✓ Alert and send child to designated Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) with suspected COVID-19 OPD Isolation area (Red and Orange zone)
<br>
✓ All patients must maintain ≥1meter distance from each other.
<br>
✓ Staff to adhere to mandatory hand hygiene and appropriate PPE (gown, eye goggles, face mask and gloves)
<br>
✓ All children (if can tolerate) and their caregivers to be given a surgical mask to wear immediately before triage.
<br>
✓ Triage each patient at the designated isolation area (Suspected COVID-19) of the waiting bay for signs of severe illness (emergency signs) 
<br>
✓Move emergency and priority cases to the examination room to perform ABCDE assessment. Examination bed/couch to be fumigated in between patients.
<br>
✓Keep limited duration in the examination room.
<br>
✓Surgical mask or N95  mask (where possible, full PPE) should be worn during ABCDE assessment.

✓ Classify as unwell (high risk) AND immediately,

✓ Alert and send the child to designated COVID-19 isolation in-patient unit for admission.

✓ If the cubicle/unit holds ≥1 patient, adhere to >1meter distance from each bed. 
<br>
✓ Admit in the isolation cubicle for:
<br>
1) Low Flow Oxygen therapy at 0.5-2L/min via nasal prongs or cannula. Use Non-rebreather mask if infant tolerates or for older children.
<br>
2) Do not exceed 2L/min for nasal prongs/cannula. Do not use nasopharyngeal airway (high risk of aerosal spread)
<br>
3) Target >90-94%.
<br>
4) If has a wheeze, add salbutamol inhaler via MDI/spacer (do not nebulise). Do not give systemic steroids unless if known or suspected asthmatic attack.
