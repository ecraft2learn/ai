answers.push(
`Triage includes screening at the entrance, identification of cases
and isolation if necessary. There should be a triage (screening)
area where visitors to the hospital are interviewed using standard
questionnaires to identify symptoms, along with temperature
checks and documentation of contacts. Individuals who meet the
case definition for COVID-19 should be isolated immediately while
arrangement is being made for swab (sample) collection from the
patient. (See the WHO guidance on triage).`

answers.push(
`No, but it is easier to use nursing staff who have little or no training
but understand the COVID-19 case definition very well. However,
other healthcare workers such as laboratory scientists, pharmacists,
doctors and even medical record officers could handle triage if
they are trained to do so and if they are not needed at their station.

answers.push(
`Triage of visitors should be conducted before entry into the facility
e.g. at a parking lot or at the entrance to the facility. That is why a
single point-of-entry for all patients into the healthcare facility (HCF)
is recommended. No one should be exempted from triage.

`Can we handle triage with only cloth masks?`
]);

answers.push(
`Linen/cloth mask is for community use and not for use in healthcare
settings, surgical masks should be used at healthcare facilities. If
there are no medical masks then it becomes critical to examine how
the cloth mask was made and how it is being cleaned, and it must
be changed every day. Do not touch the mask and perform hand
hygiene before wearing and after removing the mask. See Africa
CDC guidance on mitigating acute shortage of personal protective
equipment (PPE).`);

answers.push(
`The risk is also high if you touch your eyes while attending to patients
who are coughing or when you engage in high-risk procedures like
aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). It is, therefore, recommended
to use face shields or other equipment that protect the eyes, such
as goggles.`);

]);

answers.push(
`It is very important to wear an eye shield when performing
procedures that could cause splashing whether for COVID-19 or not.
It is preferable to wear a face mask with the face shield because the
shield does not provide complete seal around the face and there is
a probability that splashes may cross to the face (e.g. from beneath
and sides of the face shield).`);

`Are contacts with wounds and abrasions by infected droplets a transmission risk?`,
`Can one become infected if infected droplets contact a wound?`
]);

answers.push(
`There is currently no proof that infections can occur through wounds
or abrasions. Infection occurs when a person inhales the infected
droplet that falls on the skin, gloves or protective clothing, or if they
touch their mouth or nose with contaminated hands. The virus is
then transmitted through to the lungs.`);

`Are cloth masks effective to interrupt the transmission of COVID-19?`,
`Can cloth masks prevent the transmission of the disease?`,
`How effective are cloth masks?`,
`Do cloth masks protect against transmission?`
]);

answers.push(
`There is currently no evidence that cloth or linen masks significantly
interrupt the transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19
in healthcare facility settings. If widespread wearing of cloth masks
is recommended in your country, it is very important to ensure that
all other hygiene measures are maintained and encouraged, and
they should be seen as additional measures, not alternatives.
Cloth masks should be used where physical distancing is not
possible. The mask should fit properly on the face, and you should
take care not to touch the surface with your hands. Cloth masks
should be made of at least three layers of fabric. They should be
washed daily and dried properly either in the sun or with electric
iron. If cared for correctly and worn appropriately, cloth masks can
prevent up to 50% of droplets from touching the face. Do not touch
the mask with unwashed hands and sanitize or wash your hands
after touching it. See <a href="https://africacdc.org/download/simple-instructions-on-how-to-use-a-face-mask/" target="_blank>how to use</a> and <a href="https://africacdc.org/download/simple-instructions-on-how-not-to-use-a-face-mask/" target="_blank">how not to use mask</a> from

`Healthcare supplies should be reserved for use by healthcare

methods for reprocessing masks require very high technology and
they are difficult to apply without expensive equipment. Until more
precise evidence is available it is advisable to dispose the mask if it

answers.push(

answers.push(
`No, this is not encouraged. You should use a face shield to prevent
splashing into eyes and face. It is one of the options offered to
conserve N95 mask but it places additional burden on surgical

difficulty.`);

that may put them at risk of getting infected. The risk is very high
when you allow children to use the mask. Children can harm
themselves with the mask or infect themselves with it.`);

`Are there risks from wearing a mask over several hours?`,
`What risks are there from prolonged use of a mask?`
]);

answers.push(
`It depends on how the mask is worn. It is important to dispose a mask
when it is soiled or when it becomes difficult to breathe through
it. Young children (under two years) and people with breathing
difficulties should not be made to wear a mask. Medical masks and
N95 are tested to make sure that breathing resistance is not too

answers.push(
`The purpose of mask is to collect any droplet from the mouth and

answers.push(
`It is a challenging situation when there is limited PPE to enable
compliance to recommendations. However, such situation can
be avoided by preparing and adapting how work is done. When
possible, use reusable PPE that can be decontaminated locally.
Strengthen stockpiling and procurement systems to plan for future
needs as much as possible. Adopt engineering controls such as
the use of plastic screens at reception desks or gates to maintain
physical distancing at entrances or visiting areas. Reusable face
shields and cotton surgical gowns may be decontaminated locally
using the laundry and detergent or disinfectant. This reduces the
need for constant resupply of expensive single use PPE. See the

answers.push(
`This is not necessary. If you are working directly with patients and
engaging in aerosol-generating procedures (AGP), the most essential
PPE are the face shield or goggle, face mask and the coverall. We
understand that some people have worked at healthcare facilities

smaller aerosols such as intubating or suctioning of patients, and
swab collection. PPE recommended for use during such procedures
are medical gloves, N95 masks, face shield or goggles, and gown or

answers.push(
`COVID-19 is not commonly transmitted through contact with
dead bodies. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen so when
an infected person dies and stops breathing or coughing the risk
of transmission reduces. However, transmission may still occur in
some circumstances. During movement of the body, e.g. washing or
wrapping in a shroud may pose a risk of respiratory droplets being
expelled from the mouth or nose. There is also a risk of contact
with surfaces contaminated around the body when the person was
breathing and coughing.
If AGPs have been conducted, the room should be well ventilated for
at least one hour before anyone accesses it (airborne precautions
are not needed). If family members are involved in the preparation of
the body, they should wear appropriate PPE to protect their skin and
mucous membranes from contact with any respiratory droplets or
environmental contamination. Once the body has been prepared and
the room cleaned and well ventilated it is safe for family members to
approach the body to view it and say prayers. It is not recommended
to allow family to kiss the body or the shroud, but they may touch
it (i.e. holding the hand) if hand hygiene is performed immediately
afterwards.
It is important for authorities to support families in saying goodbye to
their loved ones and this should be facilitated through education and
