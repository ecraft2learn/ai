They have sent us those videos above and asked us to watch them, especially the last one then we say what we think of them. These are the notes I have taken. Washing hands is really important for the person mixing the solution and the care taker. It is also important to note that the packet of ORS is poured in one litre of water. The people in the rural areas should be told one litre equals four cups and the water has to be safe. One may see water that appears clean and think it's safe yet it's not boiled therefore we should tell people safe water means boiled water that has been stored well. We should also keep teaching care takers how to give ORS and to ensure all the things used to mix and store it are clean. Since we have discovered that it is common among children, parents must know the number of times to give the ORS and the time to do it. The parent must also know that the things used to mix the solution should be used for one day. She must cover it if not giving it to the child and also keep it in a clean place so as not to get contaminated. Thank you so much."

Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.

Since the one currently looking after the child has mental issues, there's a big problem. If Francesca said she will accompany them to the health centre, we appreciate it but we need to know their nearest VHT. We also need to know a relative who can get involved in this issue because we may dedicate ourselves to helping them and it becomes something else. We are all different. They may take it the wrong way and say we didn't involve them yet it appears they can no longer handle them. The VHT close to them should deal with their relatives who are not mentally ill to find a solution. In case they get treatment, the VHT has to monitor them to ensure they are being given food, medicine and that correct measurements are taken. This should be done with the help of the relative who should also accompany them to the health centre. That's my opinion."

In answer to your questions why are women getting disease more than men.... It is unlikely that women are more affected, but women might be more likely to be at home when you do home visits compared to men who might be out. Also women might be more willing to say they have a problem compared to men who many deny any problems. This is a very interesting insight though."

Greetings to you Catherine and well done. If I go to kirujja butoke and come across such a patient, I greet her then introduce myself to her. Once I'm done introducing myself, I ask her if she has any problems with her ears. If she says yes, I ask her if she would want to be examined. If she accepts, I write down her names, name of head of household, age, village and the ear with the problem. After that, I ask if she has any other problem besides ears. If she says no to that, I request her for some water to clean my hands. I then ask her again if I can examine her ears. If she accepts, I carefully take out my otoscope and examine her ears. In case I find her with that problem, I write it down and the particular ear I've found it. When I'm done with that, I check her hearing using the whispered voice test. If I find that her hearing is okay, I explain to her that I'm going to treat the ear with discharge. I then wash, dry the ear and give her antibiotic drops to use for five days, three drops three times a day. After the five days elapse, I go back to follow up. Also since she feels some pain, I encourage her to take some panadol to reduce it. b) I take her history in the book you gave us that looks like a receipt book. It has three papers. The white one, pink and blue. I leave the blue one to confirm that I've worked on her and she can show it to anyone who may happen to have questions. c) I ask if she has any other condition or allergies.
