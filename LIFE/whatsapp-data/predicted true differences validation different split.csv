Peer-to-peer problem solving,Case study - response,CHW,Facilitator ,"Catherine, I call the disease otitis externa because it's on the outer part where he has pointed"
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW,Group,"Greetings fellow VHTs. While on home visits, we encounter some challenges for example here in Makata there is a child whose ear is deformed. The parents don't agree with helping the child yet the child is for the country. Dorothy the supervisor also went there but the parents disagree with correcting it. What do you think we should do about it as VHTs who help people in the community?"
Encouragement,Case study - feedback ,CHW,Group, Super well done Patricia. Yes that is correct.
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW ,Group,"Greetings too fellows. I am sorry for not answering yesterday's question but I saw it. I was so occupied, was traveling and got stuck in traffic jam at some point so I was unable to. I call upon my fellow health workers to listen to what our bosses have to say. Andrew told us not to force anyone and that's the reason why we were given consent forms. If someone doesn't accept to treated, they shouldn't sign the consent form. That's why I am asking you to give up on that."
Acknowledgement,Greetings,CHW,Facilitator,How are you Andrew? Thanks for the work. Thanks for training us.

Thanks,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,CHW,Thanks for this 
Logistics,Thanks,Facilitator,Group,Thanks very much those who have given me all your different ideas about todays cases. You have given good ideas indeed. To those who have not managed to give your ideas today we try next time to see that you reply. You are not going to get any more cases up to the 11th of March. Therefore I REQUEST that if there is something you wish to talk about you use the other WhatsApp group. Thank you very much and have a good night. 
Case study - response,Management of a patient,CHW,Group,"Greetings my fellow VHTs, am Kizza Isabella, I want to inquire from other VHTs, Bryan, Catherine and  Doctor, my client called Namugga Lydia who had pus in the ear, we had give her antibiotics after a washout and she was feeling okay, but right now she came to me saying she had a bad night with too much pain in the ear and also too much pus, so am asking what can I do, I need your help, because I was thinking may be we give her some pain killers because she feels too much pain. Am waiting for your response, I am here with the patien"
Management of a patient,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,CHW, Francesca thank you very much for your reply. But after doing all that and you still find she has the wax what would you do for her? 
Case study - response,Management of a patient,Facilitator ,Group,Yes thank you so much to all vhts for these suggestions. Its hard. Ideally she needs to be in a health centre for a few weeks to get special treatment. But I don't think the mum can afford it and she has mental health issues meaning I don't think she can be responsible for the child. I agree with Karl. We should first involve the father and His parents. Some vhts should go in a group to inform them and try come up with a solution which the family think they can manage. If that fails a good samartian might have to accompany the child for a few days.
Encouragement,Case study - asking a question,Facilitator ,Group,Can any VHT use their MUAC tape and demonstrate to others how to use it properly? We can then give you feedback!
Logistics,Acknowledgement,CHW ,Peer supervisor,Dorothy I will be able to be there tomorrow at the time you said. 
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Peer supervisor,Group,"Greetings fellows. Today they have asked us to share or ask anything related to the ear project. I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr.Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much."
Case study - response,Management of a patient,CHW ,Group,"Greetings fellow VHTs. Bryan and Catherine, I was over there but you weren't around. Greetings our in charge Mr Andrew wherever you are. I got a patient who I sent to you, he went to some health centre but after discussing with Byamukama, we decided to refer him to you. Unfortunately, he didn't find any of you there. As for Annette's case, I don't differ from Edward. As we get old our bodies change. Medicines we use can also have effects at times. It needs specialists. Good night fellow VHTs. I remain Matthew."
Management of a patient,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator ,CHW, Otitis externa is more redness of the pinna and ear canal and can look like this:
Case study - response,Case study - asking a question,CHW,Group,"For the third part, my question is why is it that amongst the diseases we are examining, women are the most affected. I don't get it. Thanks for participating, supporting and doing good work. God bless you."
Case study - feedback ,Encouragement,Facilitator,Peer supervisor,Very interesting points. Thank you for sharing Edward.
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Logistics,CHW,Facilitator,Andrew I didn't get tissues for cleaning the otoscope. 
Encouragement,Case study - response,CHW ,Group,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for all the work you're doing for the country. Thanks for all you have sacrificed to treat people. May God bless you. I am sorry for being silent but it's because I lost someone and just came back on Sunday night. I turned off data during the period and forgot to turn it on. I also had malaria, was so down and it's only yesterday that I got some energy to go to Seeta but I am sorry for not replying to the question on Monday and Tuesday. Now this is my answer to today's question. When the mother asks the cause of acute otitis media, I tell her the child's immunity is still very low. I also explain to her that the condition is temporary. Regards to you all and I wish you well as you answer the questions. Catherine, Andrew and Bryan, I am on my way coming. May God bless you."
Encouragement,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator ,CHW,Super answers Francesca. Well done!!
Case study - feedback ,Acknowledgement,Facilitator,Group,"Thanks so much for correcting us about the litres of water, you are right we made a mistake we apologise - 1 litre is two cups of water. "
Case study - response,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator ,Group,"Hi VHTs, some signs of malnutrition include thin arms and legs, big belly, dry thin hair, poor skin, swollen feet, irritability, loss of appetite. "
Case study - feedback ,Management of a patient,Facilitator,Peer supervisor,"The need to be treated with cleaning the ear, then giving pain killers, antibiotic drops 3 times a day for at least 7-10 days. The may also need amoxicillin if they have upper respiratory tract infection. If the infection doesn't heal with antibiotic ear drops they may need something stronger - like oral flucloxacillin"

Logistics,Management of a patient,CHW,CHW,"Well-done Isabella, thanks for the work you are doing, sorry about that patient I think the days we were told for the ENT doctor who is coming are close therefore you can do as Hadijja had said as we wait for the doctor may be on 29th in case it doesn't work then she has to see the specialist if the antibiotics can't work because her ear problem might be worse because in most cases she can't hear and when you talk to her on the side of the ear which has a problem she can't hear you, I don't know whether she was seen by a specialist last time, but this time she has to see them otherwise if she needs surgery as we were given chance, she can go to Mbarara after being examined by the specialists."
Case study - response,Case study - feedback ,CHW ,Group,Half cooked milk causes brucella and T.B. You can get T.B if your cattle has it. We all know people infect cattle and vice versa.
Management of a patient,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,CHW,"Isabella whatever you have said is right, but before you do that you need to introduce yourself to the mother of the child and explain to her the whole project. Then you take a consent after ensuring she knows what you have explained. "
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW,CHW,"Byamukama, when a patient has puss in the ear, you have to do an ear washout after doing that as we do, you put the antibiotic drops because you like it or not such a patient must be having some wounds in the ear. That's what I think. What I had forgotten after the ear washout, you do ear mopping before putting antibiotic drops. Thank you so much"
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW,Group,"That's where I beg Andrew that most villages did not get VHTs but they have ear problems, what are we going to do? We kindly ask for a response and we see what next because there are many villages which have no VHTs but they have ear problems. What are we going to do because they have started approaching us since they know we were trained. "
Case study - feedback ,Case study - asking a question,Facilitator,Group,"After advising her to purchase steroid ear drops you then go back to see how she is two weeks later. She has not purchase the ear drops but instead asks you to get them for her freely. What can you do in this situation? Do you think people should be expected to pay for their own treatment? If so, why? "
Case study - response,Case study - feedback ,CHW ,Group,Thanks Madam Catherine for replying to me very well. The incorrect answer I saw was from Luke about ensuring children are put under a mosquito net by 6pm. I know the female mosquito that transmits malaria begins doing so at 3am not 6pm. If it was the case then all children would be sick. 6pm is too early and not only children suffer from malaria but also adults. What I have to say is we sleep under mosquito nets that ain't treated and that's why mosquitoes bite us. Sometimes they have holes. Anyway it is not right to say children should be put under mosquito nets by 12pm because adults are affected as well. That's what I want to clarify. Female mosquitoes bite from 3am. Regards to you all and I thank Madam Catherine for helping us reply to our questions very well.
