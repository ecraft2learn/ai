Peer-to-peer problem solving,Case study - response,CHW,Group,"I am Isabella Kizza. If I do wash out for the boy, dry mopping and still not find any change, I refer him."
Logistics,Greetings,CHW,Peer supervisor,"Greetings Edward, thanks for the work you are doing."
Encouragement,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,CHW,"Ok Francesca, who do you think is responsible?"
Case study - feedback ,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW ,Peer supervisor," Greetings to you all fellow health workers a part of the ear project and other things. I personally haven't understood something which I would like to before giving any advice. Edward does that man, woman or child feel pain at the hole we looked at last time or it's just swollen?"
Logistics,Acknowledgement,CHW,Peer supervisor,Edward I got your information so let me wait for this man. I have got the information very well. 
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Logistics,CHW,Group,And now fellow VHTs I have reached Mrs. Xs place. But her ear is so bad. One is very very bad. The left one has pus doesn't look good. Tomorrow Andrew will see her when he goes for the home visit. 
Case study - response,Greetings,CHW ,Group,Greetings to you all fellow health workers. I am happy for the correction from my fellow health workers about something I thought was right. Thank you so much for that.
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Peer supervisor ,CHW,"Aunt Francesca I request if you can, please take a photo of that child and share it with us here. We shall discuss it when we meet and our boss will see how to handle it. You know some of our people still overlook us. They haven't yet discovered how important we are. They love different people so if our boss accepts and we go there with him, they can probably soften their hearts. Remember a prophet is never respected where they are born. If that child gets help, they will then see the importance."
Case study - response,Logistics,CHW,Group,I was in X's home treating some people with ear problems. After I moved around but didn't find any other person with ear problems so I went back home.
Case study - feedback ,Management of a patient,Facilitator ,CHW,"Well spotted Karl (I actually missed that sinus myself !!) I think it's a sinus yes, but also otitis externa. Fully agree with your management plan of antibiotics. I'll be at seeta nazigo HC 9am on Monday Edward and will supply them."
Case study - feedback ,Acknowledgement,Facilitator,CHW,"Thank you Harriet, now what can you do for the child? "
Case study - feedback ,Management of a patient,Facilitator,CHW,"Dr Doreen said they also need If not, Ampiclox syrup and pain relief such as panadol. Luke can you make sure the person is informed and aware ? It is important."
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Case study - response,CHW ,Group,I Luke. The first thing I do incase there is no change is to refer the child to specialists because there is nothing else I can do. So I send the child to Mulago. 
Acknowledgement,Logistics,CHW,CHW,Isabella I came across people with a lot of wax. I have made it clear I think it in the other message.

Case study - feedback ,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Peer supervisor ,Peer supervisor,"As you can't do the ear wash out due to the pain, refer her to health center to get the pain killer and then give Antibiotics for a week. Apply 3 drops by 3 times a day."
Case study - asking a question,Case study - response,CHW ,Group,"How's your day fellow VHTs? Thanks for all the work. Thank God for getting us through the holiday and for keeping us alive. This is my reply to today's question as Hadijja. I can see a head with an ear that has a swollen pinna. That disease is called haematoma. When I find such a patient, I refer them to a specialist because they need surgery. Greetings and I wish you well as you reply to the question. May God be with you."
Logistics,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW,Peer supervisor,"Another thing; remind them in May that there will be an ear camp at Seeta Nazigo. The doctors are coming - ENT. Also I think let the patients give you their phone number, the mum. Then you call her once we know the date. "
Case study - response,Management of a patient,Facilitator ,Group,I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.
Thanks,Acknowledgement,CHW,Facilitator ,Well done Miss Catherine. We have understood the questions but most of the VHTs are now in the garden planting because it rained. We have understood the questions and we shall reply. Thanks so much.
