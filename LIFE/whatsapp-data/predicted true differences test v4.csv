Management of a patient	Case study - feedback 	Encouragement - praise	Encouragement - inspirational message	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	CHW 	 I can understand their frustration Nora. That is why having the medicines as VHTs and going house to house is so important. You build trust and respect of the community like how you are doing with Anna Nabwire the 97 year old lady who you are treating with antibiotic drops. Imagine how hard it would be for her to go to Seeta Nazigo 3 times a day for treatment with drops. You are giving her an excellent service.
Case study - asking a question	Case study - feedback 	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Group	"The VHT should explain to him that to confirm the hearing loss they would need to refer him to a specialist called an audiologist who can test his hearing using special tests. Unfortunately however, there are not many audiologists in Uganda. The ones that are there are expensive and only in Kampala. There are some treatments for hearing loss like hearing aids and cochlear implants but these are also expensive. A hearing aid costs 6 million shillings for one, and the batteries need changing each week. Each battery costs 20,000 shillings. 

There are other things that the VHT can recommend. For young children with hearing loss they can go to special schools for the deaf for example. Here they can learn sign language and communicate. They can also give advice such as wearing ear protection to prevent hearing loss in the first place if they are exposed to loud noises in their job, or avoiding medicines which can cause hearing loss. 

The VHT can also explain to family members how to communicate with someone who struggles to hear properly. For example, speaking slowly, clearly and loudly. Not covering the mouth with the hand when talking to someone. Pointing to objects they are referring to. Being patient.

If a baby has two parents who are deaf they should spend time with family members who are not deaf as this can otherwise affect their language development. 

Remember people who are deaf have normal intelligence. "

Question: How do you advise Patricias mother to prevent diahorrea in the other children?"

We kindly ask for a response and we see what next because there are many villages which have no VHTs but they have ear problems. What are we going to do because they have started approaching us since they know we were trained. "

Isabella - sorry for the problems. Bryan, Catherine, Andrew thanks for all the work and the knowledge your giving us. About that patient, when I reach and find out she didn't buy the medicine or she doesn't have money or when she doesn't have anyone to buy for her and when I also don't have money to give her I tell her according to todays situation you have to care about your life. She might have a friend, who might be willing to lend money to help. I also advise don't resort to local medicine. She can try do some work to get money like weaving mats to try get money out of it.

We need your opinions on how to handle this matter. Harriet identified a malnourished child in Makata who had a red MUAC tape. The child is 10 months old. The mother has learning difficulties and has no money. She is not able to bring the child to the health centre where they will need to be for a few weeks while the child has the appropriate feed and medicine and is monitored. We have provided them with a referral letter but we want you to advise us  on what you think should be done. Thank you.

I sent the message but it took awhile to be successfully sent because of data issues and I apologize for that. This is what I have to say about today's question. I have a challenge of not having medicine for certain illnesses like wounds and pus. We don't have that. There's a lady I once told Bryan about who has so many wounds in the ear but I have been unable to take her photo. I have tried looking for her but she went to the garden. She's elderly. Also Anna, she still has pus. Sometimes she gets well but when she travels she gets the pus again. I have been unable to find her too because I am sort of occupied but I am sorry. Regards to you all and I wish you a good day. May God be with you."
