She is 80 yo lady, I gave her ear drops which she has been using. Today is the 5th day. I have washed the ear, but I have seen the wax is near the canal. It is so hard you can see it without putting the otoscope, so even if you put tissue papers they can't go in. I request for one of our helpers to come help me. "

We may think it's a joke yet it's very serious. I am also not sure whether the pus is coming from the ear or the pre-auricular sinus. I am just not sure about that. If it is bad they need to be taken to an ENT surgeon to handle them. Thanks."

Quality assurance	Supportive environment - mutual learning	Communication and information - giving opinion	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	Peer supervisor	"Greetings fellows. Since the one currently looking after the child has mental issues, there's a big problem. If Francesca said she will accompany them to the health centre, we appreciate it but we need to know their nearest VHT. We also need to know a relative who can get involved in this issue because we may dedicate ourselves to helping them and it becomes something else. We are all different. They may take it the wrong way and say we didn't involve them yet it appears they can no longer handle them. The VHT close to them should deal with their relatives who are not mentally ill to find a solution. In case they get treatment, the VHT has to monitor them to ensure they are being given food, medicine and that correct measurements are taken. This should be done with the help of the relative who should also accompany them to the health centre. That's my opinion."

I sent the message but it took awhile to be successfully sent because of data issues and I apologize for that. This is what I have to say about today's question. I have a challenge of not having medicine for certain illnesses like wounds and pus. We don't have that. There's a lady I once told Bryan about who has so many wounds in the ear but I have been unable to take her photo. I have tried looking for her but she went to the garden. She's elderly. Also Anna, she still has pus. Sometimes she gets well but when she travels she gets the pus again. I have been unable to find her too because I am sort of occupied but I am sorry. Regards to you all and I wish you a good day. May God be with you."

I would like to thank all the VHTs and our supervisors for everything you're doing. I can see a picture of someone either a child or an adult plus an ear which I think is the left one. If the person was born with that hole which we call lukatu in Luganda, it poses no threat. But from what we have been told if it causes problems like swelling, the advice I can give to the person is to refer them to an ENT specialist for further examination. The biggest problem is what we copy like pricking ears with machines which makes the ear look like two in one. That's my view. Thanks so much. It's me Matthew Johnson, VHT Makata."

We kindly ask for a response and we see what next because there are many villages which have no VHTs but they have ear problems. What are we going to do because they have started approaching us since they know we were trained. "

Communication and information	Supportive environment - mutual learning	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	CHW	"Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thanks for all the work you're doing. About the issue at hand, I discovered the child. After discovering her, I was so touched because she's older than Mulungi but see the way she is. Her mom came to see me after giving birth to Mulungi when she already had her four months ago. Mulungi was only one week and a half then. I found that child in a terrible condition and was able to talk to the father but he showed me he can't do anything about it. I was very touched and wanted to take away the child from them so she could stay with me, but then I would be having many children to look after. I already have Mwesigwa and Mulungi and I am usually busy. Due to that, I decided to leave the child with her parents but this is what we agreed on. She brings the child to my place every morning and I prepare for her heavy breakfast that I feel would be helpful. Also, that child takes milk. She is sick therefore her appetite is quite low but I usually give her milk and pack some for her to take back home. I give her the amount I can afford since I don't have cattle. She eats everything we give her like matooke, rice and irish potatoes. She always leaves my home at around 11am or midday. I also give her food to eat later on. I suggest that unless someone is going to accompany her to the health centre, she shouldn't go because she won't handle. If there's anyone who can volunteer, please do. I heard someone asking who her nearest VHT is, she is Francesca. As for her husband, hmmm God indeed paired them up. Her father in law is very old like Francesca has told you. He is also very weak. The mother in law is around but also has mental problems. I suggest we come together as VHTs to help them. If one has anything, one can give to the child. She will eat or drink it well. Her appetite is not that low. Have a good day. May God be with you."

We need your opinions on how to handle this matter. Harriet identified a malnourished child in Makata who had a red MUAC tape. The child is 10 months old. The mother has learning difficulties and has no money. She is not able to bring the child to the health centre where they will need to be for a few weeks while the child has the appropriate feed and medicine and is monitored. We have provided them with a referral letter but we want you to advise us  on what you think should be done. Thank you.

Supportive environment	Quality assurance - patient management	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	No need to give antibiotics 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW 	Half cooked milk causes brucella and T.B. You can get T.B if your cattle has it. We all know people infect cattle and vice versa.
Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	Supportive environment - inspiration	NA	NA	Facilitator	 I can understand their frustration Nora. That is why having the medicines as VHTs and going house to house is so important. You build trust and respect of the community like how you are doing with Anna Nabwire the 97 year old lady who you are treating with antibiotic drops. Imagine how hard it would be for her to go to Seeta Nazigo 3 times a day for treatment with drops. You are giving her an excellent service.
Communication and information	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator 	Wow - well done Dorothy. That was a great video. You can see clearly the tape was 'green' meaning she is not malnourished. Well done and well done for selecting the correct tape. Brilliant!
Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Thanks	Communication and information - acknowledgement	NA	NA	Facilitator 	Ok thanks Gordon. Not necessarily true. For ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA (AOM) you can usually wait for 2 days to see if the child improves. They need pain killers and if they feel better no need to refer to a hospital.

What I know is that it's the only day I have missed answering a question on this platform. I got a problem my fellows. I had a function to attend to and I had a hard time finding a car yet I was receiving many calls from the function that I was running late. I am still there till now.

Gordon, Dorothy, Hadijja, Matthew, Francesca, Patricia, Karl, Luke, Jane, Harriet ne Edward thanks for taking the time. Malaria is transmitted through mosquitos biting you.

Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - mutual learning	NA	NA	NA	CHW 	"Also Edward, if they feel pain I advise you give them pain killers. After the pain killers and the pain reducing, you refer them to a doctor because they are the ones who will be able to handle it. They told us an ENT surgeon can operate it  and it doesn't get re infected or bring pus. That's my view from what Catherine told us. It was the answer on one of the days."

Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - mutual learning	Communication and information - clarifying information	Supportive environment - greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	Peer supervisor	"Greetings fellows. Today they have asked us to share or ask anything related to the ear project. I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr.Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much."
