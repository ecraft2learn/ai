Also, this lady called X who had pus from the ears kept complaining of pain but I asked her and she said she no longer feels it. She also said she can at least hear a few words when someone speaks. We shall go back and check on her. Another thing, there's also X. When you look at Monday's program, I would like Andrew to see him as well. Thanks and good night."

RDT is only used to check malaria. The microscope shows a lot including typhoid. You very well know here at Seeta Nazigo before they introduced RDT, the microscope couldn't detect malaria even when someone felt so much pain. Typhoid can hardly be seen in dispensary or government health centres. It's commonly detected in clinics."

Communication and information,Quality assurance - patient management,Communication and information - acknowledgement,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator ,I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.
Communication and information,Supportive environment - mutual learning,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,It's true. One litre of water equals two cups of water not four.

Bryan and Catherine, I was over there but you weren't around. Greetings our in charge Mr Andrew wherever you are. I got a patient who I sent to you, he went to some health centre but after discussing with Byamukama, we decided to refer him to you. Unfortunately, he didn't find any of you there. As for Annette's case, I don't differ from Edward. As we get old our bodies change. Medicines we use can also have effects at times. It needs specialists. Good night fellow VHTs. I remain Matthew."

Communication and information,Quality assurance - patient management,Communication and information - logistics and planning,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,Ok the little spot I am not concerned about.

Communication and information,Quality assurance - patient management,Communication and information - making a request,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"Now I have a problem. There is a patient I have here. She is 80 yo lady, I gave her ear drops which she has been using. Today is the 5th day. I have washed the ear, but I have seen the wax is near the canal. It is so hard you can see it without putting the otoscope, so even if you put tissue papers they can't go in. I request for one of our helpers to come help me. "

Communication and information,Quality assurance - patient management,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,No need to give antibiotics 
Communication and information,Supportive environment - mutual learning,Quality assurance - patient management,Supportive environment - encouragement and praise,NA,NA,NA,CHW ,"Francesca VHT Makata, your ideas are very good. Specioza's child like you have seen in Andrew' message was referred to Mukono health centre IV. A malnourished child who has been referred is sometimes admitted for a few weeks. While at the health centre, they are given food to eat that is sometimes provided by the government. He's therefore asking who can look after the child in a situation where they are admitted for three weeks. What you said is okay if they give them the food and they return home with it. Depending on the child's condition, they are sometimes admitted like in the section of ""Mwana Mugimu"" at Mulago. They are given food and medicine to get well in such cases. It's not a matter of giving them food before they are seen by the doctor because they are given certain nutrients that are beyond our smaller health centres. That's the point."
Communication and information,Supportive environment - moral support,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,We can see you Monday Matthew and look at your leg for you.
