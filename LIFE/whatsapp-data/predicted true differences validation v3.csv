Management of a patient,Case study - response,CHW ,Group," Greetings to you all VHTs. All the symptoms show she is dehydrated therefore I give her first aid of ORS. I can mix the ORS and give it to Patricia's mother. I then advise her to give it to Patricia as she takes her to the health centre. When she gets to the health centre, I may have written the referral form for the nurses to see what the problem is. If not, I escort them and explain it to the nurses so they can put the child on drip immediately."
Case study - feedback ,Case study - response,Peer supervisor ,Group,I see the ear drum is reddish and has pus.
Management of a patient,Case study - response,Peer supervisor ,Group,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work. This is my reply to the question. If Miss Annette insists on me giving her antibiotics, I tell her it will bring problems for her since her condition doesn't need them. I tell her I would if she had pus or any other discharge, or had a perforation on the ear drum. The advice I can give her is to go to seeta Nazigo health centre for further examination and treatment. I personally don't have the treatment for it."

Case study - feedback ,Management of a patient,Facilitator,CHW,"Dr Doreen said they also need If not, Ampiclox syrup and pain relief such as panadol. Luke can you make sure the person is informed and aware ? It is important."
Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator ,Group,Children who have otitis media a lot are more at risk of developing hearing loss later in life. The next question will be released tomorrow morning. Good night VHTs. 
Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,Group,He has Hearing loss. You should ideally refer him for assessment by a specialist called an audiologist if you suspect hearing loss. 
Case study - feedback ,Case study - response,CHW ,CHW,"Greetings VHTs; there is a question which had remained that Catherine had asked us - the one saying who is supposed to buy the medicine. First of all I greet you all. Those who wee there yesterday in the training, thank you so much Catherine, and also our coordinator Andrew and Mr. Bryan and also other doctors who gave us the last training. Both of them. They all did a great job for the country because it was all about health but I thank the VHTs who came from far. If I am to respond to the other question the patient has to try as much as possible to buy the medicine, because in the government hospitals - sometimes there is no medicine other than panadol which can't heal her problem. Let us see if we don't have another question - let me keep scrolling. "
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW,Group,"About that issue of Mr Matthew writing in this group, I will be helping him because we share many things, I will see him, things are not easy, I will teach him well."
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Case study - response,CHW ,Group,"Greetings to you all our health workers, Mwebe, Andrew, Bryan, Catherine and thanks for what you're doing for us. I would like to thank all the VHTs and our supervisors for everything you're doing. I can see a picture of someone either a child or an adult plus an ear which I think is the left one. If the person was born with that hole which we call lukatu in Luganda, it poses no threat. But from what we have been told if it causes problems like swelling, the advice I can give to the person is to refer them to an ENT specialist for further examination. The biggest problem is what we copy like pricking ears with machines which makes the ear look like two in one. That's my view. Thanks so much. It's me Matthew Johnson, VHT Makata."
Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,Group,"Thank you the causes of hearing loss are: Medications (e.g. certain antibiotics cause hearing loss if the dose is too high like gentamycin), loud noises, old age (prebycusis), infections (measles and mumps) are some of the causes of hearing loss. "
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Case study - response,CHW,Facilitator ," I give the child's mother antibiotic drops to give to the boy. I also ask her to dry his ear. In case of any pain, I give him pain killers. Thank you so much."

Case study - response,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator ,Group,"Hi VHTs, some signs of malnutrition include thin arms and legs, big belly, dry thin hair, poor skin, swollen feet, irritability, loss of appetite. "
Management of a patient,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW ,Group,"We heard about that child's situation and this is what happened. She was taken away from the mother by her maternal aunt when she was still very young. After failing to look after her, she brought her back malnourished. Her mother is not okay mentally but we have been advising her to take her to the health centre and to feed her on nutritious foods like soya and beans. Only challenge is both parents have mental issues. Andrew referred her to the health centre but she needs to go with someone. I heard like Francesca saying she would accompany her. Also, that child is not 10 months. She's about to make 2 years though she looks like she's below 1year. We should encourage the father to get some money, and someone to accompany them to health centre IV in Mukono so that they get treatment. I think she mostly needs nutritious food and medicine as the health workers will prescribe. That's what I have to say but that child is way older than 10 months. We know when she was born."
Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,Facilitator,Group,"Greetings VHTs - thanks to all those who replied to todays question. The question was talking about poor feeding in children. The first one was asking what is malnutrition. When a child does not get enough food to eat to help them grow, develop or fight disease. When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar 
•	They are ill e.g. they have HIV
•	They do not have access to enough food 
•	They are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months
•	Not receiving routine vaccines
•	Lack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein "

Management of a patient,Case study - response,Peer supervisor ,Group,Good morning brothers and sisters. I won't differ from my fellows about Patricia's issue. I give her ORS but the challenge is one may not be having it at that particular moment and may need to buy it. We can also mix it the easy way using salt and sugar and they need to take it until they get to the health centre. Another thing we may add on is glucose for the child to regain energy. That's what I can do.
