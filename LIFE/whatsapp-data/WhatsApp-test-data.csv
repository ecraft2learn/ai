Qiana we have not heard from. Can someone check she is ok?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facilitator,CHW 8,Hi Matthew. Please share this in the seeta nazigo \ makata group. This space is for the cases only. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Peer supervisor,CHW 8 ,Sorry Mr Matthew quick recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facilitator,CHW 8,I'm very sorry Matthew. I didn't realise this was your leg. I think you should visit the doctor to get it examined. I can also look at it for you next week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facilitator,CHW 8 ,Mr. Matthew the messages you have sent in this group are meant for the other one. This is meant for the case studies. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,Group,I was in X's home treating some people with ear problems. After I moved around but didn't find any other person with ear problems so I went back home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 4,Well done Isabella. Welcome back from the church service. What are we going to do about Miss X? I haven't got a reply yet. I was suggesting we fix some time tomorrow evening and give her some antibiotics because of the wounds so she can get some peace. How do you see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 3,"It could be true because she has wounds. Also, this lady called X who had pus from the ears kept complaining of pain but I asked her and she said she no longer feels it. She also said she can at least hear a few words when someone speaks. We shall go back and check on her. Another thing, there's also X. When you look at Monday's program, I would like Andrew to see him as well. Thanks and good night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 4,"Isabella, that issue you have pointed out about our patients is good . As for X, if only you had seen Doctor last time. Now X and her husband got lucky. They got for them a specialist who will be working on them. If you had brought that child for his ears to be examined, we would have gotten somewhere and doctor would have helped us. They would go at once with the rest because he will be the one driving them. Don't you see in his message?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,Group, I have seen all the messages my fellow VHTs. Those sympathising with me about my disease plus advice on how to use our groups. Thank you so much. Good night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,Group,"I thank my fellow VHTs like Dorothy, Luke, Bwendi, Janet, Karl, Isabella and the rest we work with. Patricia, thanks so much. Thanks for replying to questions. It motivates our teachers. It shows we were giving it our all during the training. They also get to know the people they placed in communities to help the people are doing well. That's it. God bless you and keep it up. Amen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 2,"Gordon Byamukama, did you just move around? You should say you also examined. We haven't understood you really well. Did you move around and after went home or you examined and found no one had an ear problem? But you really didn't find anyone with a problem? Not even wax?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 4," My fellow health worker Isabella, I haven't been so clear but I went to Samanya's home and treated the patients there. They had wax. But because I had run out of time, I only went to their nearest neighborhood and there after  decided to go back home. Those in Samanya's home had wax and I treated them all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 2,Isabella I came across people with a lot of wax. I have made it clear I think it in the other message. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHW,CHW 3,Harriet tomorrow we should go back to see Mrs. X. Some of them are given appointments but need to be followed up to make sure we don't loose them. Please pass by my home and we will go see. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
