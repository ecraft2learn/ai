I agree - it is hard to find specialist ear doctors in Uganda. However you VHTs in Makata, Seeta Nazigo, Kavuule and Kirujja Butoke and now becoming experts in ear disease. You will be leaders for future VHTs and examples for other VHTs and Community Health Workers around Uganda and the world."
Management of a patient,Case study - response,Greetings,Thanks,NA,NA,NA,Peer supervisor ,Group,"Good morning members. Thanks for the work we have started doing today. That lady Annette, we discovered yesterday she has itching in the ear, so we were told that sometimes itching comes because of some bacteria in the body. But in all situations there is no way that antibiotics are recommended for this. So if they are so hard on me and want antibiotics I refer them to the specialist. Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me. Then I inform her - let those people examine you but if they find a problem in you I will see if you can get medicine but right now I don;t have the medicine for you. "
Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,Greetings,Thanks,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,Group,"Greetings VHTs - thanks to all those who replied to todays question. The question was talking about poor feeding in children. The first one was asking what is malnutrition. When a child does not get enough food to eat to help them grow, develop or fight disease. When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar 
•	They are ill e.g. they have HIV
•	They do not have access to enough food 
•	They are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months
•	Not receiving routine vaccines
•	Lack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein "

Thanks Catherine for translating for us yesterday's question. Now for today's question of Joyce and her mother, once I find she has acute otitis media I can't handle it as a VHT.

Also, this lady called X who had pus from the ears kept complaining of pain but I asked her and she said she no longer feels it. She also said she can at least hear a few words when someone speaks. We shall go back and check on her. Another thing, there's also X. When you look at Monday's program, I would like Andrew to see him as well. Thanks and good night."

Q4A. Have you met a lot of people in the community with hearing loss? What do you think are the main causes of hearing loss in Mukono? Q4B. Do community members get frustrated that there are no resources for treatment such as hearing aids? 
Q4C. How can you as VHTs improve the situation for the those with hearing loss if there are not many audiologists and hearing aids are expensive? "
