Therefore they lose hope, even in Seeta Nazigo Health Centre, they may be offering free dental services but a poor person even fails to get 5000 shillings to bring him or her for treatment which is not the case which the rich.",

Patients are reluctant to go to government health centres not because they are asked for money but because of long queues. They spend a lot of time waiting in line and after fail to receive the medicine. They're instead sent to get it from clinics. Another issue is the government health workers who happen to be very tough. Also, patients are given under dose. That's what stops them mostly. For the second question, children who grow up in village families don't get medical check up so they end up getting problems. On the other hand, their counterparts from town families tend to have rich families therefore receive enough care and medical check up. Most rich families are found in town.

Some people are reluctant to go to the health centres because they're asked for money which is true. Much as they do ask for it, the government facilities have no medicine. You can only find it there once in awhile. Another reason is they take long to attend to the patients. Some patients can be very ill and decide to sleep around the health centre but when the nurses arrive they insult them instead. Some nurses are very rude but very good ones are there too.",

What is important to know is that people can be allergic to lots of different things e.g. fur, dust, antibiotics, pollen, nuts, milk etc. The response also differs. For example some people have a minor reaction e.g. itching. Others have a very severe and dangerous reaction. Their lips swell up and their airway can close off. This more dangerous reaction is much rarer but important as the person can die.",

I like how you are working in pairs with Isabella. It is a good idea and other VHTs might consider going in pairs on their home visit or asking their supervisor (Edward or Dorothy) to accompany them once in a while. In answer to your questions why are women getting disease more than men.... It is unlikely that women are more affected, but women might be more likely to be at home when you do home visits compared to men who might be out. Also women might be more willing to say they have a problem compared to men who many deny any problems. This is a very interesting insight though.",

When I'm done with that, I embark on examination for the second time since I would have finished the wash out and given them some pain killers. I then check their hearing using the whispered voice hearing test. After that I give them a copy of the form to confirm that I have successfully treated them and then I take the pink one to the health centre. As for the white one, I write in it like Dorothy told us i.e the phone number of the patient and where they stay to help me remember.",

Question 2) I take her history but before that, I give her the consent form to confirm that she has accepted the treatment I will be giving her. I explain to her why she has to sign it. After accepting, I give her pain killers. When she says the pain has reduced, I do the ear wash out to remove the discharge. Next I dry it like I said in the first place. Another question, what important questions I'm I supposed to ask her. They include, how long she has had the pain, if she has had any treatment before and then I examine. After examining, I ask if she has any allergy. If she says she has, I call my bosses to inquire from them what to do like they told us.",

When she grants me permission,  I examine her ears. If I discover there's discharge, I explain to her that we are going to wash those ears, dry them and then put antibiotics.

It helps me while doing follow up. I take another copy to the health centre and keep one in the book. After that, I ask for her names, the people who are apart of her household, her age, village, number of people in her household, how long she's had the condition and the treatment she's had so far. I ask her if she has any allergy. If she says yes, I request her not to use the medicine because it may cause complications. If she says no, I ask her to go ahead and use it. After 5 days, I go back to follow up.",

If I go to kirujja butoke and come across such a patient, I greet her then introduce myself to her. Once I'm done introducing myself, I ask her if she has any problems with her ears. If she says yes, I ask her if she would want to be examined. If she accepts, I write down her names, name of head of household, age, village and the ear with the problem. After that, I ask if she has any other problem besides ears. If she says no to that, I request her for some water to clean my hands. I then ask her again if I can examine her ears. If she accepts, I carefully take out my otoscope and examine her ears. In case I find her with that problem, I write it down and the particular ear I've found it. When I'm done with that, I check her hearing using the whispered voice test. If I find that her hearing is okay, I explain to her that I'm going to treat the ear with discharge. I then wash, dry the ear and give her antibiotic drops to use for five days, three drops three times a day. After the five days elapse, I go back to follow up. Also since she feels some pain, I encourage her to take some panadol to reduce it. b) I take her history in the book you gave us that looks like a receipt book. It has three papers. The white one, pink and blue. I leave the blue one to confirm that I've worked on her and she can show it to anyone who may happen to have questions. c) I ask if she has any other condition or allergies. Some of them don't know what allergies are but you can explain to them. If they don't have, I go ahead. That's my reply.",

About seeing the other 33 year old lady in Kirujja Butoke I saw her and she has a hearing loss in the left ear and it also has pus, even pain, too much pain. The first question - I first ask for permission, then I examine the ear, then I was my hands, then I examine the ear inside and outside. I ask about allergies. If examine and find too much pain and pus I give them pain killers, then after 3 days I get pain killers. Then after washing my hands I examine. Then I write the history. I ask the names of the household head, the age, the date, the sex. After that I fill the remaining parts in the history book. How has the pain been, which ear has the problem. Then I ask about other illnesses. After seeing the outer ear is normal and the ear canal has pus, then after I examine then I write. I give her the form, put one at the health center, I keep one too. I forgot - I also need to get consent too. Part b - I guess I answered that in Part A. I also washout, with iodine and water. I keep washing and dry mopping until there is no pus then I give antibiotics. 3 drops, 3 times a day. 5-7 days.",

Do you think this makes patients avoid going to the hospital even if they need to? What other reasons do people give for not going to a big hospital like Mulago? Q4b. In Uganda in 2009 there were 16 ENT surgeons. In 2015 this number increase to 35, however this number is much lower than a county such as South Africa where there were 246 ENT surgeons in 2015. Why do you think Uganda faces this situation? Q4c. How do you we can we link the limited number of ENT surgeons to the community better so that patients who need surgeons input can be seen and followed up? ",

You see even us when we go out in the community to treat ears, you can work on three people and feel fatigued already. Those health workers get tired, and that's why they're unable to work on some patients. Others ask for bribe. Another issue is, when ears just have discharge some people don't feel pain. In Uganda when someone doesn't feel pain it's hard for them to go to the doctor. That's my point. Also, our government doesn't mind much about health issues. It only cares about security issues. Actually the security budget is higher than that of health. If only the health budget was bigger, we would be so lucky.",

They will continue using it to treat only very complicated diseases and someone has to pay some money. The amount I heard him mention was too high to be affordable by common man. Another issue is some people don't know where it's located and the queue is always long. Doctors always want some money which we may refer to as bribe. 4b)In 2009, we had few doctors because all doctors who have gone to school end up going abroad (brain drain). It is an important issue that is caused by low salary. 4c) Those doctors should be coming to health centres grade II, III and IV. They should give out their phone numbers. That's my reply to the questions. I remain Byamukama Gordon.",

What stops people from going to Mulago, my first question is 'Yes, people fail to go there if you don't have any relatives in Mulago or friends or contacts, if you don't have anyone you know you can be there for a week and noone will see you. You need to know someone to get treatment. Another is issue is these doctors - we need to be careful. If you go and they are in a rush they are tough. So even some need money, but the way you approach a doctor. But when you give the money, they receive the money. They look at you with a bad face. They are not compassionate.

After studies the child can't find jobs and those people who are doing those jobs are so old. The parent sees they have lost money on the child. They think of another option - so they tell the child to go abroad to look for jobs. Those people abroad have more opportunities that here in Uganda. That is why they go abroad. So here we don't have experts. Another problem and cause, though our doctors work hard - they get little pay. They know the money is not enough. Even getting that money some of them don;t get it on time. They worked for their money, but the administrators take months and months. They stay in self contained rooms which are costly, the need to buy food, pay bills. All this is hard if you don't get paid promptly. These are big sacrifices for them to make. If the conditions are so hard why can't such a doctor just go abroad where they are paid well. ",

We need more training. We can then examine the patients. We should also go house to house looking for people. So it can be easy for the people to approach the doctors if they have a referral letter. So when the patient goes to the health center, they do not look like a new one. So they have a starting point. Another thing the government needs to start paying VHTs as we are trying to save lives. We need help as we need to do this work effectivly. The government should add money to the health system instead of funding ministers and members of parliament. They are not doing much. There is another one, the government puts too much money in things thst do not matter. Education and health really matter - the teacher teaches the future doctor, the teacher teaches the future president, but if a teacher doesn't have a good life things for the future won't go so well.

But they don't so they go abroad. That is why we don't have enough doctors. Part C. Those doctors should be brought to those small HCs like Mukono because it is near by.

Today's question requires us to give the causes of hearing loss. Personally, I will give you 4 or 5 causes. First of all, Mr. Jamil is 37 years but has had the problem since childhood which implies he must have suffered from severe malaria leading to that problem. Another cause is some medication like quinine. Formation of a baby in the womb is another one.  There are cases where some body parts are not fully developed and in this particular case it could be the ears. Also, the bone responsible for hearing could be having a hole leading to hearing loss. Fifth cause is Jamil might have been exposed to different sounds like loud places, loud music and welding workshops. That's my opinion.",

Disabilities for example some teachers at schools slap students in the ears. In addition to that, violence in homes causing one partner to beat the other which may damage their ears and cause hearing loss. Using strong medicine like quinine. Lastly, old age though that gentleman is 37 which is not so old. That's my reply to today's question. I remain Gordon, VHT Makata.",

To be honest, quinine has damaged many people's ears. One uses it without taking enough drinks. Remember these are children and we have to take responsible for their wellbeing. Now, he might have been given quinine by the parents without water. He might also have been sickly as a child and the parents kept giving him quinine tablets. We know quinine tablets cause hearing loss. Secondly, the condition might have started while in the womb. The mother might have been alcoholic, had low immunity or wasn't eating certain nutrients when pregnant which help in the proper formation of the bones of hearing. It might also have been as a result of tough parents who slap their children causing the ear drum to burst. That's what I think. In Seeta there's a 14 year old kid who has a problem with hearing and the mother says quinine is the cause.",

In case a pregnant woman falls sick and doesn't get treatment, for example from severe malaria, it affects the baby's brain. Some pregnant women use strong medicine for treatment. Others use alcoholic stuff, drugs like marijuana which affects the baby's brain causing hearing loss. Some people use head sets with loud sound which leads to bursting of the ear drum. Accidents also cause hearing loss for instance when one falls and the ears are affected. May be diseases from old age too and the treatment given thereafter like quinine. That's my reply.",

Another issue may be a perforation because  Dr. Esther told us sometimes there are times when certain parts of the skin fail to come together to form a normal ear or the bones of hearing might have an abnormality. Another cause is one may have got an accident and not realize how bad it was. Others are exposed to loud sounds like those who work in factories, where as others use headsets with loud music yet their hearing may not have been good resulting into profound hearing loss.",

I also thank Catherine and Bryan for the work they're doing. I thank Andrew for loving us. May God bless you all. This is my reply to today's question. Yesterday, we confirmed Jamil has a hearing loss. I think his mother could have fallen sick or got very stressed while pregnant. Some homes are violent and full of fights and when a pregnant woman goes through that, it affects the baby's brain. That man could also have fallen sick while still young and the parents didn't notice in time which worsened the ears. He might also have grown up around a place with loud sounds for example a stone quarry, bars, lodges or cinemas. His parents may have also communicated with him in a manner where they kept shouting. Other causes include;- Formation of his bones of hearing could be abnormal.\n-Medications we use and not just quinine but others too. \n-Use of certain things. One may have a minor problem but is advised to use lots of things which cause complications hence bringing infections.",

There are some treatments for hearing loss like hearing aids and cochlear implants but these are also expensive. A hearing aid costs 6 million shillings for one, and the batteries need changing each week. Each battery costs 20,000 shillings. \n\nThere are other things that the VHT can recommend. For young children with hearing loss they can go to special schools for the deaf for example. Here they can learn sign language and communicate. They can also give advice such as wearing ear protection to prevent hearing loss in the first place if they are exposed to loud noises in their job, or avoiding medicines which can cause hearing loss. \n\nThe VHT can also explain to family members how to communicate with someone who struggles to hear properly. For example, speaking slowly, clearly and loudly. Not covering the mouth with the hand when talking to someone. Pointing to objects they are referring to. Being patient.\n\nIf a baby has two parents who are deaf they should spend time with family members who are not deaf as this can otherwise affect their language development. \n\nRemember people who are deaf have normal intelligence.

Different kinds of treatment that happen to be bad especially for us the poor people at the grass root. You can get to the health centre and find no medication yet you have a very sick child with malaria and convulsions. You then seek advise from different people who tell you to buy quinine claiming it cured their sick children. One ends up giving those tablets to their children but forget to give them lots of water. I know quinine ain't bad but it becomes a problem when a parent fails to give water to the sick child all the time so it can dissolve it. The child ends up losing her hearing in the process. I call upon the government to bring back the waterly quinine because it's good for the children and doesn't cause hearing loss like the tablets. We were trained on how to self Medicate in Mukono, due to the situation at the health centre of inadequate medicine. Coartem is so expensive in clinics   yet quinine is cheaper. At shs. 500 you can get yourself two tablets but for coartem the first dose is at shs. 5000",

These are my opinions on the causes of hearing loss in Mukono. So many factories especially loud ones lead to producing of children with hearing loss. So many stone quarries that are loud as well also cause hearing loss. Medication given in health centres. Parents neglecting sick children when the diseases are still in their early stages like malaria, measles also causes hearing loss.\n\nB. Yes, people get frustrated. Treatment for hearing loss is very expensive especially hearing aids. Besides being expensive, people are not aware of where to find them. They may end up buying fake ones after spending a lot of money on them. They are not even sure of the amount of money they cost. In addition to that, they also need special care like phones. One may be unable to afford batteries. The machines used to test hearing loss are so rare. You will get to the health centre and not find them yet the distance travelled to get there might have been long. Poverty amongst people really discourages them.\n\nC. As a VHT, what I can do is to advise pregnant women to get maternal services right from when they find out they are pregnant till when they give birth. They should also take good care of their babies and not to neglect any disease. They should also spend less time in loud places like the factories we talked about and discotheques which may affect their ears. Lastly is to request the government to put restrictions on loud places so that they can reduce on the sound they produce. If such restrictions are put in place, our people won't be so much affected. Those are my opinions.",

Miss Catherine and Bryan, I send my regards to you. Thanks for serving and loving us. This is my reply to today's question. The biggest cause of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono is sickness like severe malaria especially amongst children. You decide to go to the health centre, line up till 3pm and by the time they get to you the child is worse. They give you quinine tablets to give to them but you're too poor to afford drinks so in the process, the child ends up losing their hearing.",

This is my reply as well to today's questions. A. What causes hearing loss in Mukono is chaos. People are always rioting, bullets are being shot, so much noise, factories are many, stone quarries all of which cause hearing loss. Another issue is people's mindset of being bewitched all the time. It makes them think they will never get fine. A baby is born with a hearing loss, but the parents don't mind about it and thereafter claim someone bewitched them when pregnant or their child. Thirdly, sometimes when we give birth to babies we don't take responsibility to check their hearing yet if we do it earlier the problem can easily be detected.",

Someone like me who is able to hear needs to do the few signs I know happily, show them that I care and love them and that I am not special because they need company. I can also teach these people things they do not know like how to keep their ears clean and free from infections much as they are deaf. I also teach them spiritual things. God created people and all is possible before Him. He used to heal the blind, deaf and lame people. I can therefore advise them to go and see pastors who are not fake. There are those who have believed with faith and got their hearing back after prayers. That's how I've answered those questions. May God bless you.

Thanks you for Catherine and Bryan for the work you are doing for us. The one greeting you is Qiana Kigwana. This is how I reply my first question. In Mukono the reason why we have people with hearing problems is because some parents when they get pregnant they don't want to go to hospitals for check up - then the kids get ill. Some used to go to private shops and buy qunine and swallow - yet malaria is too much. So after taking the quinine they take too much of it so by the moment that they produce that child they come out with a hearing issue. Another thing someone can produce a child who hears very well, but sometimes the child gets sick but gets too much malaria then they get treatment with qunine then the quinine becomes too much because my inlaws child has this issue. They always advise them to use qunine which is why the child does not hear, yet the child was good but these days we use sign language. Now he is in S1, but he was produced when he was normal but the problem was quinine. Quinine was the medicine every just took without even knowing if it was the right one. Even pregnant women. But because when pregnant women go to hospitals they get a different drug. ",

Because even the teachers who teach them use sign language. So that way they can develop themselves instead of staying the same when they don't know anything. Yet in those technical schools some do craft work, weaving baskets. They also teach them as people who hear. They also have a chance and an opportunity because those people train in construction, carpentry sand many more. They can be trained in sign language - a bit like the blind with braille.Because the blind can't see but they have special equipment. So the same applies to the deaf. There are many things they can use to help them. Though they can't hear they can see what can be done. So they can see each sign they are taught. ",

The mother told me in the first 3 months the child had pus in the ear - they treated it, it got normal. Then 6 months later it came back. But right now the child is 4 years and the pus has come back. Right now the child does not have pus - but if you stand at the back of the child the child does not hear. So instead you have to stand infront of the child otherwise the child will not hear you. But behind they do not hear. So I need help about this child. I also have another one who is the elder of this one - 6 years old. They are girls. They also told me they have a similar problem - they used to have pus, the mum put warm water and would drain it from the ear which meansthe child never got antibiotics.  I examined and didn't see any pus but wax and itching. So I need your advice what can I do? Bryan and Catherine I need your advice as I fill the forms - because if they need antibiotics I don't have them right now. But I will do what is possible and let you know. Thank you so much. ",

She has been bothered by itching in her ears for the last 5 months. She has no pus and no wax in her ears. When you look inside the ear with your otoscope it looks normal.  \n\nQ1.

If I examine and find no problem like wax, pus or even a hole, it means the skin has an infection. Another reason is some people have allergies and may not be aware. Ears react faster than any other body part. That's my reply. It's either allergy or a skin infection. Rubbing them to ease the itching is also another one.

When I go to Makata and find a 50 year old lady called Annette with itching in the ears, and I take her history but on examining I find nothing like pus or wax in her ears, what I have to say doesn't differ from what others have already said or will say. I have three reasons. First of all, Annette is now old and her age is prone to diseases. Secondly, she might be having germs in her body. Thirdly, she might be using some medicine she is allergic to. I think those reasons could be causing itching in Annette's ears. May be another reason is she could be having wounds that we are unable to see. By the time she inserts sticks, it means the finger is too short to reach the inside. There could be wounds that are still not so visible. It's just like a swelling that itches but only becomes a wound after it bursts.That's my opinion.",

Sometimes you find a child or adult with ringworms in the head, another with dandruff yet another may not be having any. She may be having a skin disease in the hair that may be affecting the ears when she tries to scratch it.

Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication.

Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me.

The reason you have not been hearing me - my charger got an issue, so I did not have anywhere to charge from. That is why you did not hear from me. For todays case, this is how I reply. What I advise Mrs. Annette. I don't give her antibiotics, antibiotics are only given to people with pus in the ear and perfs. But those who have itching aren't given antibiotics. I also advise her to keep her ears clean, if it has wax, use olive oil. So that we can soften the wax and washout. But if the itching goes on I refer the lady to the hospital. ",

My answers are not also different from the others. About that lady called Annette from Makata, about her problem of itching, the truth is that some patients want to pretend they know more than us so they force you to do things that can harm themselves. According to me - if she has asked me to do that and when I examine there is not indication for antibiotics, I don't give her them. Because if you put the medicine in the body it becomes poison if there is no need for it. So I cant give someone something which is going to cause harm. So I tell her the truth - this medicine can't be given to you, so I refer her to the specialists to understand what causes the itching. ",

For todays case my answer is this - that lady Annette when I examine it and it has no wax, pus, hole but has itching I tell her that there might be fungus making the ear itch. In the field some people call you, you examine them but just have itching. Others have wax, but with itching in the ear. And others have normal ear drums but itching in the ear. I also remember we talked about this issue and we said people are always asking you for treatment. So for us we say Bryan, Catherine and Dr, Andrew give us the right answer and give us the medicine that can heal the itching in the ear. There is a man I know - his ear has things like dust which also brings itching in the ear. Even if they use sticks to clean their ears. But they can't use the sticks if the ears are not itching. Which means they have an issue with their ears. Even me I am also one of them. Before I was washed out it also used to itch me sometimes - that is why someone can try to insert something in the ear which can damage it. So we don't have a perfect answer; I just refer them to the specialist so they can be assessed properly. That is my view - have a good night. I have an issue with the network ",

People should buy it for themselves because the medicine might be so expensive so if we buy for them we might fail. Yet it is so bad to start something and we do not finish it so I think they should buy the medicine for themselves. Why? Me I want them to buy it for themselves cos people will be more careful. We are careless me inclusive. For example you give them free olive oil to put in the ears, but you go there and try to wash out the ear so when they buy it they will take the responsibility to make sure their money is not wasted. When we give it for free they can drop it on the road side even when they have not finished their doses. They throw the medicine - if we give for free they won't take it seriously. So I want them to buy it for themselves. That way they will be more responsible. Another thing when the person buys his or her own medicine it is properly prescribed and the money. So the person can also tell a friend that I bought the medicine for myself, it is not from the government or free of charge. ",

Thanks Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. It's me Qiana and this is my reply to the first question. The reason as to why there are so many deaf people in Mukono district is because of the parents. They would get pregnant and refuse to go to the health centre. In case they fell sick, they always bought quinine and would swallow an overdose. At the time of birth, they would end up producing deaf children. Others would give birth to normal children but would treat children with quinine. My in-law's child is a victim. He had celebral malaria and they treated him with quinine. He's now  deaf in senior one but uses sign language. Quinine was so common back in the days. Pregnant women were not allowed to use it though and were given fansidar instead. That's the reason as to why there are many deaf people. Whoever used quinine fell victim. Well done fellow VHTs. Forgive me my network is not good but I've replied to the question. As for today's question, in case I check in the 50 year old lady's ears and find nothing yet they itch, it means there are germs. We talked about that issue and were wondering the cause because a lot of people ask us. We said Catherine, Bryan and Andrew should give us the answer and the treatment for it. I know a man who has ash coming out of the ears and it also causes itching. The reason as to why they insert sticks in the ears is to ease the itching. I also had issues with mine before the washout and used to insert in sticks. Such sticks may damage the inner ear. I can only refer such a patient to specialists. That's my reply but the network is not good.",

Another thing is that when you use your money to buy medicine you use it as directed. But in most cases people become careless because they got it for free. They did not put any money from their pockets in - but if they use their money they can do things right. So I think people should buy medicine according to the way Uganda is.

When I go to Annettes place, and find out she didn;'t buy the medicine that she was told to buy to stop itching the truth is when she asks me to buy it for her, I sit down with her then I explain to her that I examined you, I told you the issue, I told you what to do. So in that case I don't have the medicine. We are also not given such medicine from our coordinators so I request you to care about yourself and look for all possible ways if you don't have money - ask from your family members or friends such that they can help you to get that medicine; because when you delay the situation can get worse. The itching won't stop on the outer ear. It will also affect the inner part. When the illness gets worse - it gets expensive to treat.

The truth is when someone doesn'thustle to get something, they don't appreciate the value of that item. But for a person who has worked hard to get money to get something or to get money aperson will always be so careful about how to use that money. So the person will say I worked hard for this money so I can't play around. But if a person doesn't know where something came from they don't take any care or doesn't take any responsibility. Another thing - people who give you free medicine care about your life more than you. If you give it free its like you are forcing things on them - so let them love their live first. That is why they have to buy the medicine themselves so they know what it is like to go through to get the money. They need to know the cost of the medicine - if they don't know the cost they wil use it poorly. If they know it is 100,000 they will use it wisely.  ",

So Annette, I would advise her buy that medicine and after 1 week when I go back and find she didn't buy the medicine and asks to get the medicine for free. I tell her I can't do that for free. Instead she has to look for money so that she can get the medicine. What I inform her, they wrote the medicine but it's not there at the health centre so we have to buy it and I also think people should buy medicine for themselves because it is their life and the government can't manage to treat 40 million people. It doesn't have the ability to get that medicine. That is why you see the medcine at the health centre - for example you see it at the health centre for 3 months doesn't even last for a month at the health centre. So that is what causes people to get upset. They just examine them and write them a script for a medicine to be bought elsehwere. So I tell her you go buy that medicine and also people have to care about their life. They shoulnd't wait for the government, because the government is you and me. It doesn't have that ability - that is why private hospitals or pharmacies are so many in the country to help the government. We have to pay some money so people should know life is more important. They should also take into consideration that when they get money, put some aside for treatment incase they fall sick, That is my suggestion for today. ",

About todays case that lady Annette about the medicine they directed her to buy - the steroid drops. If she was directed to buy the medicine and we find out she didn’t buy it either because she didn't have money or wants it for free I think we counsel her. She shouldn't take her life for granted. Because the illness will become greater. So I sit with her. I advise her to look for the money in all ways so she can go buy that medicine. Not every medicine is there in the government health centres. We always find whenever we go to government health centres we don't find certain medicines so we have to go to private pharmacies. So I sit with her and advise her with counselling. The next question,  I say yes, Buying medicine isn't bad because there is some medicine that is so expensive that even the government can't give it to everyone in Uganda. Therefore buying medicine is not bad - it is a responsibility for a person who is sick to take care or her life and to use the medicine and not waste it. By working hard, getting money they don't waste it. ",

Then I inform her I don't have enough but I bought you the first dose. Another thing I do - I refer her to the hospital to see that she gets the medicine. The next question said, do you think ppl should buys medicines for themselves, I say yes because they needto care about themselves before the illness gets worse. Another thing - it helps them to be responsible for their lives. Because if they keep waiting for something for free, they don't care enough. Yet, the illness gets worse. Another thing, is because in the government hospitals the medicine is not there. When you reach there they tel you to buy the medcine yourself. But on the other side, it is in the governments responsiblity to protect and look after its people. Another thing is that people shouldn't buy medicine for themselves because they pay tax. ",

I can't give it out. When she is not able to buy the medicine - if I have sme money I try help her. But when I also don’t have, I say, because of your life try as hard as possible to ask from your friends or relatives to get some money so you can buy the medicine. Because if you don;t treat, the illness will get worse. It might even affect the ear drum. Also the government has not cared for the people - like the hospitals aren't good at all. But other governments, when they care about health and put medicine in the hospitals the people don't suffer. But todays government has not helped at all. It wants people to buy everything for themselves yet some people don't have money and even if you are working the money isn't enough because you are using it on many things. So it hasn;'t helped us - even when you go to the hospital the medicine isn't enough , but I don't discourage her. I keep encouraging, I follow up, I ask her if she has a little moeny I try top up with my own so she can get the medicine. That is my response. ",

They all did a great job for the country because it was all about health but I thank the VHTs who came from far. If I am to respond to the other question the patient has to try as much as possible to buy the medicine, because in the government hospitals - sometimes there is no medicine other than panadol which can't heal her problem.

They can also examine her and if they have no medicine for her problem, they can write it down for her to get it from any pharmacy. If she insists on getting antibiotics I explain to her that I examined her ears and there's nothing like pus or perforations. Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication. I strengthen her and advise her to go to the health centre for medicine that can stop that itching. In case they don't have it, she can get it from the pharmacy after them writing it down. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much.",

We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine.",

I advise her to keep her ears clean and in case there's wax, we can put oil to soften it and then do an ear washout after 5 days.

Harriet, you are right in saying you need to refer to specialists, and that this can cause damage to the bone, however it will not cause cancer. It is more likely to cause a brain infection.",

It is hardly dangerous to the person but if it is swollen or has any wounds, I can apply antibiotics for the wounds to dry. I don't think there's a big problem that can come out of it because most of the time it's congenital and poses no risk. Thanks so much.",

There were only two groups remaining and that's it seeta Nazigo and VHT. In the photo I can see someone with a hole on the ear at the front not the back. I can see that it's okay. Normally if it is not an infection, most people are born with it. May be when they get it after they've grown up due to infections but this one to me looks like the person was born with it and has no problem. I remember we were told during the training that it's called pre-auricular sinus. If it has a problem I refer the person to specialists because I can't do anything about it. If it has no problem I encourage them telling them it has no problem and to feel free like me. Also not to worry that it could cause hearing loss. Thanks so much.",

I have seen the question very late. Forgive me. In the picture it's like there's a child but an older one who was born with something like a hole on the pinna. I usually see them on people but they hardly have any problems with them like pain. If I find someone like that having a problem with it, I don't give them any other advice but refer them to any ENT specialist for further advice or even treatment. But from what I know they hardly cause any pain unless the one bearing it experiences some changes otherwise they never have any problems. It's congenital so I advise the person to go and see ENT specialists. That's how I can handle it. I remain VHT Gordon at Makata. Thank you so much though I've replied late. I am sorry.",

Our fellows whom we do the work with Bryan, Catherine and Doctor well done. I hadn't replied to the question because my phone was dead. The hole we are seeing in the picture on that person's head is called pre-auricular sinus. Most of the time like our fellows have said, the person is born with it and may not be dangerous. But if they discover it's dangerous by discharging pus and swelling, the person needs to see ENT specialists for treatment. What I can do is to make them a referral for surgery. That's my view.",

If a mother comes with a child, I first take their history which includes the symptoms and the period the child has had those symptoms. I know when a child is sick they lose appetite but the only way it can be confirmed is by taking a laboratory test. Sometimes the child may be suffering from malaria but then they fail to detect it from the lab. In that case it could be typhoid. Typhoid can sometimes fail to be detected from blood and that is why some patients go to Seeta Nazigo feeling sick but the lab results show they're normal.

The question is about what causes malaria and this is my answer. Most people have mentioned not sleeping under a mosquito net for malaria so I'll leave it at that. Let me talk about typhoid. Typhoid affects the intestines and most of the time it is not diagnosed with a blood check up. They usually use waste. It is caused by eating dirty things over and over for a long period of time. This could be through touching soil while digging that may have been contaminated by feaces and after eat a jack fruit or you could be having worms. Normally we all have malaria in our bodies but it only comes out if we let the worms in our bodies multiply like it is the case for T.B and measles. That's my answer for today's question.",

I know at seeta nazigo health centre they treat it. As long as the patient comes suspecting it could be malaria, I just refer them for blood check up. I also advise them to avoid the following.

If they come to me after getting checked and confirming they have malaria, I give them coartem three tablets in the morning then more three after 12 hours. That is done for three days. In those three days I accompany those tablets with one panadol twice a day because malaria causes pain in the body and headache. Panadol therefore acts as a pain killer that relieves pain in this case but coartem is the real medication for malaria. I also advise them to take a lot of drinks like passion juice, ORS and others. Some think drinks refer to alcohol so they go to bars and buy it claiming the doctor told them to do so and buy alcohol for themselves! They have to be soft drinks so clariy this for those drunk fathers!",

If they come to me after getting checked and confirming they have malaria, I give them coartem three tablets in the morning then more three after 12 hours. That is done for three days. In those three days I accompany those tablets with one panadol twice a day because malaria causes pain in the body and headache. Panadol therefore acts as a pain killer that relieves pain in this case but coartem is the real medication for malaria. I also advise them to take a lot of drinks like passion juice, ORS and others. Some think drinks refer to alcohol so they go to bars and buy it claiming the doctor told them to do so. They have to be soft drinks.",

Those who don't have should try and get them. Secondly they have to slash the tall grass around them to prevent mosquitoes from breeding there. Thirdly they should dispose off all broken bottles around them so that mosquitoes don't breed in there when it rains. Fourthly, they should close windows and doors as soon as it starts getting dark to prevent mosquitoes from entering their houses.

Thirdly there are always broken tins that can contain some water and that water can be a breeding area for mosquitoes.I always advise them to either remove them or burn them in case they are plastic. They should also close windows or doors as soon as it starts getting dark because it's the time mosquitoes enter houses looking for food or where to hide. If they get malaria, it is important for them to get medication and ensure they complete the dose. In case they don't complete the dose and the malaria recurs it's usually more deadly. My question is why do people complete the malaria dose but still feel the symptoms of malaria? I would like to know why. Some of them say cannot sleep without a mosquito net but still suffer from malaria. What causes that too?",

Today's question requires us to give the ways we can advise our community to prevent malaria. First of all it is important to inform parents to ensure that their children are already under a mosquito net by 12pm. To be honest the mosquito that transmits malaria becomes active at 12pm. Someone may tell you they always sleep under a mosquito net but usually suffer from malaria. It means the mosquito bites them at 12pm. Another one is to drain stagnant water around their homes or put oil in them because oil kills mosquitoes. They should also slash tall grass and bushes. My question is why don't they train us on how to check for malaria because we always work on children?",

My data was loaded on MTN yet the sim card wasn't inserted in. I also spent a lot of time at the health centre treating patients. Thanks a lot Andrew. Now this is my answer to today's question. I won't differ so much from my fellows. I must sensitize people in my community about sleeping under mosquito nets. Others include clearing bushes around their homes, draining stagnant water that is sometimes caused by brick laying, avoid planting maize near their houses because mosquitoes breed from there, collecting and burning tins and completing the dose once one suffers from malaria. People swallow half way and assume they are okay because they feel better. My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? The other advice I can give to them is to close windows when it gets dark. May be avoiding using dirty utensils for food and eating cold food. That's what I have to say.",

RDT is only used to check malaria. The microscope shows a lot including typhoid. You very well know here at Seeta Nazigo before they introduced RDT, the microscope couldn't detect malaria even when someone felt so much pain. Typhoid can hardly be seen in dispensary or government health centres. It's commonly detected in clinics.",

What I would tell the people in my community about preventing malaria doesn't differ so much from what my fellows have said. They include sleeping under a treated mosquito net, slashing tall grass and clearing bushes around their homes, covering holes that retain water now that we are in a rainy season and removing broken stuff like basins and bottles. They should also close windows and doors as early as possible before mosquitoes enter. They need to put screen nets in their windows too. That's what I can tell the people in my community. To answer Edward's question of whether eating so much maize can cause malaria, I think it doesn't. When someone eats the body reacts and their temperature rises which blacks mistake for malaria but it's just high temperature and not malaria. Thank you so much.",

My question is, people in our areas ask us that since we advise them to sleep under mosquito nets and the government gives them those nets free of charge, can't they also give them the medicine used to treat them? Some of them are low income earners so after washing them they cannot afford it. That's my question. Have a good Sunday and regards to you. I apologize for being the last one to answer the question. Mistakes are human but I am sorry. It's me Hadijja.",

The incorrect answer I saw was from Luke about ensuring children are put under a mosquito net by 6pm. I know the female mosquito that transmits malaria begins doing so at 3am not 6pm. If it was the case then all children would be sick. 6pm is too early and not only children suffer from malaria but also adults. What I have to say is we sleep under mosquito nets that ain't treated and that's why mosquitoes bite us. Sometimes they have holes. Anyway it is not right to say children should be put under mosquito nets by 12pm because adults are affected as well. That's what I want to clarify. Female mosquitoes bite from 3am. Regards to you all and I thank Madam Catherine for helping us reply to our questions very well.",

Also why do children under 5, pregnant women and those from western Uganda prone to malaria compared to other people? Karl. To answer your questions, some mosqitoes carry malaria Karl, others do not. Therefore one person might be bitten by a mosquito like the female anonphales which carries malaria, and the other person may be bitten by a male mosquito which does not carry it. Those in western Uganda have higher rates of malaria as the number of mosquitoes there are higher. Pregnant women and children have weakend immune systems compared to adults so are more likely to get malaria. Qiana asked  My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? Qiana, thank you. To answer your question: Although they might be sleeping under a net with no holes, they could have been bitten at any other point before they fall asleep. For example at dusk when they are collecting water. It only takes one bite to get malaria. Francesca asked My question is why does fatigue cause malaria? Francesca, malaria causes fatigue as you get fevers, get dehydrated from sweating and the body feels weak. Also it can damage the red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. Isabella asked \"They train them to do blood check ups for malaria. Is it possible with us too?\" Isabella - thank you for your enthusiasm. Right now we are not able to provide RDTs and medicine for malaria to the VHTs, since we only have a small amount of money. We think though that now you are aware that if a person presents to you with the symptoms of malaria you will know to advise them to get an RDT, check for malaria and refer them to the health centre to seek treatment if they require it. This is something you should ask the supervisors of Omni Med since they are the ones who are responsible for other disease except the ear. ",

Most cases of Acute Otitis Media occur in children under 5 years of age. They should take pain killers such as Panadol and after 48 hours they should start to feel better. Most children do not need antibiotics, however if it does not improve in 48 hours you should re-assess the child. You should also advise the mother to treat any other issues Joyce has – since she is coughing a lot and feverish you should advise her to check whether or not she has a respiratory tract infection and treat this if so. \n\nIf the child keeps getting otitis media frequently there is an operation which puts little tubes called grommets in the ear drum (see picture below). This helps to reduce the risk of perforation of the ear drum.  ",

I have also seen today's question and I won't differ so much from my fellows. First of all I encourage the mother not to be afraid because it happens in children because their bodies are weak. What causes the disease is poor nutrition since most children have low appetite. Balancing their diet is also hard yet they need all kinds of food. I also tell the mother to maintain hygiene and not to pour water in their ears. Also they need to find out and treat any other diseases like malaria and cough because they cause acute otitis media. We know pain killers cure the disease in two days if there's no other disease. May God be with you. Good night.",

This is known as mastoiditis. This is an emergency and she should urgently get him to see an ENT specialist. The specialist should give them antibiotics and most children will need a surgery called a ‘mastoidectomy’ which removes the infected part of the mastoid bone behind the ear. \n\nThis is a scan of the head – you can see the mastoid air space is filled with an infection where the arrow is pointing. This area needs to be managed. ",

I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr.Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much.",

Regarding Bwendi's challenge, if it's true that the child has deformed ears and you have spoken to the parents but they have refused to accept correcting them, make use of the leaders. Sometimes those parents are not even biological ones. If the leaders fail, I suggest you give up on her. The offer is free but she still doesn't want. Make use of the leaders so they can try to talk to her because some people undermine us. Not everyone listens to us. That's my advice.",

Some people assume they are symptoms of malaria and conclude it's the case, others think it's because of worms whereas others have no idea why. I suggest we discuss that problem amongst children and adults since they suffer from it too with some not knowing the cause. One may have  diarrhoea and stomach ache without malaria.  In that case, some assume it's because of worms or over eating maize, mangoes and meat. I request we discuss it so that our bosses can sensitize and teach us. Thank you so much.

Patricia, a three year old child has diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is caused by a lot of things like typhoid and malaria. It refers to releasing watery stool since normal waste should be solid. If it contains some blood, it's called dysentry. I advise the mother to take the child to the health centre or I give them first aid of Oral Rehydration Salt ( 2 spoons of sugar and a pinch of salt mixed with water). That's what I can do. I also tell my community members that diarrhoea refers to waterly stool. That's how I have answered the question.",

Diarrhoea is watery stool and once someone gets it like that three year old child, it just flows. That's how I understand it. The people in my community know about diarrhoea  that it is waste that's watery and the frequency one goes to the latrine ain't the usual one. They call it \"mbiro\" like our colleague mentioned. There are many causes of diarrhoea especially amongst children. Sometimes it's due to severe malaria. Other children get it when developing teeth, eating dirty things or contaminated food, not washing hands yet they touch lots of dirty things and typhoid. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea I can think of. Another one I had forgotten is sometimes a child may eat food that may affect their stomach or may be allergic to certain foods and the reaction is diarrhoea.",

Diarrhoea is a condition when a child releases more stool than they are meant to in a day. The stool is watery unlike the normal solid one and is released frequently. It is also the reason the child loses energy in their body. Diarrhoea is caused by many things including typhoid, eating dirty things like food contaminated by houseflies, uncovered left over food, dirty mangoes and sugarcanes picked on the way and not washing hands after going to the toilet.

What I think of Karl's answer that diarrhoea is caused by eating dirty stuff differs a little from his. Someone who eats dirty things gets typhoid but diarrhoea is caused by other things. One who eats dirty things passes out stool with blood but diarrhoea is caused by a lot of other things like too much heat in the stomach, eating a lot of food stuff and many others. That's what I think. Thank you.",

        "anonymisedMessageWithPseudonymReplacementsAndRemovedImages": "Greetings fellow VHTs , our bosses and well done. This is my reply to the question of the three year old child with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea refers to passing out abnormal stool. Much as someone is supposed to pass out stool that is soft and not so hard, this one is way soft. It is actually watery and we call it \"mbiro\". That's my definition for diarrhoea. The people in my community call it \"mbiro\"( running stomach) while others call it \"kidumusi\". I think it is caused by eating dirty things like uncovered food contaminated by houseflies or cockroaches, eating feaces, not washing hands after visiting the toilet or after touching dirty things before eating especially children. Children eat whatever they find and it doesn't matter if they have just been to the toilet or from playing. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea. I advise the person to go to the health centre  for examination since malaria can also cause it. I also advise them to take ORS and other drinks like passion fruit juice. If they can't afford it, they can make it themselves by mixing two spoonfuls of sugar in a pinch of salt and they need to take it frequently. The spoon for measurements should be very small. Thank you.",

They also have to keep the finger nails short, and also the mother has to wash her hands. They need to use soap. Also the plates and other things they use need to be clean. They have to be washed in time and dry well. So put them on a rack under the sun. They also need that drying rack and a clean jerry can for water. She has to keep the child clean, sweep the compound, not littering the area for pests, and flies. They have to have a rubbish pit where the rubbish can be put and far away so the flies aren't around where the utensils are. Where the toilet has a cover. ",

My advice for todays question - be very hygenic in the home whether in the kitchen, the house, or the things she uses to prepare food. Another thing I advise her is to spray the cockroaches and flies and to not let them to get on the food. Also I advise her to cover the toilet. Another thing I advise her is not to keep animals around the house because Catherine told us that isn't good. Make sure you cook meat well. Also I teach her to tell the kids to wash their hands after they eat and the mum with soap even when preparing the food for the kids. Also giving them boiled water. Also boiling the water at home used to cook food - because using water which isn't boiled also causes diahorrea. ",

They have sent us those videos above and asked us to watch them, especially the last one then we say what we think of them. These are the notes I have taken. Washing hands is really important for the person mixing the solution and the care taker. It is also important to note that the packet of ORS is poured in one litre of water. The people in the rural areas should be told one litre equals four cups and the water has to be safe. One may see water that appears clean and think it's safe yet it's not boiled therefore we should tell people safe water means boiled water that has been stored well. We should also keep teaching care takers how to give ORS and to ensure all the things used to mix and store it are clean. Since we have discovered that it is common among children, parents must know the number of times to give the ORS and the time to do it. The parent must also know that the things used to mix the solution should be used for one day. She must cover it if not giving it to the child and also keep it in a clean place so as not to get contaminated. Thank you so much.",

Malnutrition is when a child is not fed on a balanced diet. A balanced diet refers to food with all nutrients for example posho. A child has to be given food with all nutrients so malnutrition depends on what the parents of the children feed them. Some parents do not ensure that the food given to their children is balanced. In my community, the condition is called kwashiokor. The other question is about the causes of malnutrition. Most of the time we live in poor conditions. We would love to feed our children on a balanced diet but we cannot afford it. That's my answer to the question.",

People in my community refer to malnutrition as \"musana\"(marasmus).Some of the causes of malnutrition include eating food that is not rich in all nutrients i.e food responsible for body building(proteins), energy giving(carbohydrates) and development of the brain. Good nutrition helps to keep children healthy and makes their bodies strong enough to fight against diseases. They also grow well and turn out to be intelligent. Other causes of malnutrition include parents not taking good care of their children and lack of resources. Some parents overlook important foods like soya beans, silver fish, vegetables and instead feed on foods like meat that they perceive to be more important because they are expensive.

Now, today's question requires us to define malnutrition regarding the child called Enoch that we saw from Kavule who was looking very thin. Malnutrition is when someone eats the same type of food daily instead of eating the three different types of food. The three different types of food  include body building food, energy giving food and one that fights against diseases. If you miss out on any of that, you become malnourished. There are people who eat cold food. Cold food is not useful to the body and causes swelling of cheeks and loss of body weight especially amongst children. Eating little food also causes malnutrition therefore one must eat food that's enough for their bodies. In my community, the condition is called \"musana\". It is common amongst children because their bodies are still developing and their immunity lowers if they don't get the right amounts of food I mentioned. That's my answer to today's question.

The first one was asking what is malnutrition. When a child does not get enough food to eat to help them grow, develop or fight disease. When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar \n•\tThey are ill e.g. they have HIV\n•\tThey do not have access to enough food \n•\tThey are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months\n•\tNot receiving routine vaccines\n•\tLack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein ",

        "anonymisedMessageWithPseudonymReplacementsAndRemovedImages": "Greetings fellow health workers. This is my answer to the question. We have been asked to define malnutrition in children and how it affects them. Malnutrition in children refers to eating fried food daily. Fried food with so much oil ain't good. We no longer feed our children on non oily food like our ancestors used to do. As long as one eats oily food even if it is ground nuts or chicken, it causes malnutrition. Malnutrition causes a disease called marasmus and children with that disease have loose skins. They need to be fed on soya peas and beans that are not fried. We have all the nutritious foods  in Uganda. I don't differ from my fellows who said malnutrition can also be referred to as musana. We can prevent it by eating a variety of foods for example one can prepare beans and mix them with bananas and about 2 pumpkin leaves. If you do that, the child can get better. The beans shouldn't be fried.",

I am sorry I have just seen yesterday's question now and all the other messages but let me answer it before we receive today's question. In my community, malnutrition is called musana or kwashiokor and it is caused by poor feeding amongst children. Poor feeding means the person lacks some nutrients needed by their bodies i.e not eating a balanced diet. A balanced diet must contain body building food, energy giving food and food that strengthens immunity and helps the body to fight against diseases. It includes vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and vegetables. All those foods should be given to the child. If they eat all that, they cannot look like Enoch with a thin body, swollen feet and swollen cheeks. We have also been asked the causes of malnutrition. Malnutrition could be caused by poverty but also some people overlook certain things. They claim to not have time to ensure their children feed on a balanced diet so that laziness in taking care of children causes that condition. You find a child feeding on cassava and ground nuts or sweet potatoes for three days without change yet they are still very young. In such a state, the child is bound to become malnourished .",

Another method I can use is that of the tape called MUAC which stands for Mid Upper Arm Circumference and it has three colors yellow, green and red. If I use that tape and it shows yellow, it means the child is not that badly off but if it indicates red then they are malnourished and need to be fed to get better. That's how I can tell.

The symptoms I can consider when assessing a child that looks malnourished like Enoch include the following. First of all they look sad and irritated. One can easily tell their bodies lack water, blood, fats, salt and calcium. Such children have very pale skin, swollen bellies, swollen cheeks, sunken eyes, thin hair and swollen legs. They also feel thirsty all the time since their bodies lack many nutrients. They feel weak and pain when one touches them. That's what I have to say.",

I would first of all advise Enoch's mother  to take that child for immunisation like my fellows have mentioned. The symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, swollen cheeks, pot belly and sometimes swollen arms. Such children tend to be sickly and take long to heal even with treatment. Another symptom is low body weight for their age. Also, they are always sad and do not play with others and they look tired all the time. If you lay them down on their bellies, the skin from their thighs to the buttocks becomes wrinkled. That's how I can tell if Enoch is malnourished.",

Edward is in Seeta so if there's any VHT around who can get to me in 40 minutes, please do because I need help.

I suggest VHTs within that area should explain to both the grandparent and father the situation at hand. They should tell them the child is malnourished and was referred to the health centre so that they also get involved. If they don't get involved, then a good samaritan will have to accompany them and stay with them in case they are admitted. If there's one, that's good but the child's relatives would have been the best. That's my opinion.",

Only challenge is both parents have mental issues. Andrew referred her to the health centre but she needs to go with someone. I heard like Francesca saying she would accompany her. Also, that child is not 10 months. She's about to make 2 years though she looks like she's below 1year. We should encourage the father to get some money, and someone to accompany them to health centre IV in Mukono so that they get treatment. I think she mostly needs nutritious food and medicine as the health workers will prescribe. That's what I have to say but that child is way older than 10 months. We know when she was born.",

If Francesca said she will accompany them to the health centre, we appreciate it but we need to know their nearest VHT. We also need to know a relative who can get involved in this issue because we may dedicate ourselves to helping them and it becomes something else. We are all different. They may take it the wrong way and say we didn't involve them yet it appears they can no longer handle them. The VHT close to them should deal with their relatives who are not mentally ill to find a solution. In case they get treatment, the VHT has to monitor them to ensure they are being given food, medicine and that correct measurements are taken. This should be done with the help of the relative who should also accompany them to the health centre. That's my opinion.",

It's true the child's father is around but is no better than the mum. The other relative is the paternal grandfather but he is 100+ years. I think much as the parents are not mentally okay, they have done something because the child looks better than she was when they had just brought her. I suggest if the child is given treatment, us VHTs don't stay very far from them and can check on them once in awhile. The mother told me the problem is she doesn't take milk and only takes porridge after being forced. The other food she tries to eat is rice and posho. Also, she can hardly afford it but if she gets it, she's able to feed her. She's also capable of looking after her child since she's not that badly off mentally. I suggest if the child gets treatment, we can check on her every now and then to show her how to give it to her. That's my opinion.",

        "anonymisedMessageWithPseudonymReplacementsAndRemovedImages": "Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thanks for all the work you're doing. About the issue at hand, I discovered the child. After discovering her, I was so touched because she's older than Mulungi but see the way she is. Her mom came to see me after giving birth to Mulungi when she already had her four months ago. Mulungi was only one week and a half then. I found that child in a terrible condition and was able to talk to the father but he showed me he can't do anything about it. I was very touched and wanted to take away the child from them so she could stay with me, but then I would be having many children to look after. I already have Mwesigwa and Mulungi and I am usually busy. Due to that, I decided to leave the child with her parents but this is what we agreed on. She brings the child to my place every morning and I prepare for her heavy breakfast that I feel would be helpful. Also, that child takes milk. She is sick therefore her appetite is quite low but I usually give her milk and pack some for her to take back home. I give her the amount I can afford since I don't have cattle. She eats everything we give her like matooke, rice and irish potatoes. She always leaves my home at around 11am or midday. I also give her food to eat later on. I suggest that unless someone is going to accompany her to the health centre, she shouldn't go because she won't handle. If there's anyone who can volunteer, please do. I heard someone asking who her nearest VHT is, she is Francesca. As for her husband, hmmm God indeed paired them up. Her father in law is very old like Francesca has told you. He is also very weak. The mother in law is around but also has mental problems. I suggest we come together as VHTs to help them. If one has anything, one can give to the child. She will eat or drink it well. Her appetite is not that low. Have a good day. May God be with you.",

Specioza's child like you have seen in Andrew' message was referred to Mukono health centre IV. A malnourished child who has been referred is sometimes admitted for a few weeks. While at the health centre, they are given food to eat that is sometimes provided by the government. He's therefore asking who can look after the child in a situation where they are admitted for three weeks. What you said is okay if they give them the food and they return home with it. Depending on the child's condition, they are sometimes admitted like in the section of \"Mwana Mugimu\" at Mulago. They are given food and medicine to get well in such cases. It's not a matter of giving them food before they are seen by the doctor because they are given certain nutrients that are beyond our smaller health centres. That's the point.",

Its hard. Ideally she needs to be in a health centre for a few weeks to get special treatment. But I don't think the mum can afford it and she has mental health issues meaning I don't think she can be responsible for the child. I agree with Karl. We should first involve the father and His parents. Some vhts should go in a group to inform them and try come up with a solution which the family think they can manage. If that fails a good samartian might have to accompany the child for a few days.",
