Some of our VHTs had made a mistake of mobilizing the people to come on 5th where some were asking for loud speakers to pass through people while informing them like those of Kirijja butooke which is not right.  The right thing is that one you are trying to clarify, because even me I was here today and a certain lady who was in church and she said they were told in church to go to the Health Centre for treatment. I forwarded another one to you who was also having the same information, I told her to come to you for assessment first, and if her problem is worse that's when she will be able to see the Doctor.",

I would suggest that we get training about using the hook and after that we get pain killers because truly, people know that the treatment is for free as you know things of Uganda and also a village can not be the same as it is in town, if someone expects that treatment is free and the person comes with a problem with the ears, when the person has pain, and itching, you examine the patient may be you find when the ears are normal but with itching and pain or when they have any abnormalities but sincerely the patient goes back with only olive oil without any pain killers to reduce on the pain and yet you trained us about the pain killers. I request Doctor to add that in our work so that our work can be good instead of someone coming and complaining that I took my ears thinking they are going to help me, I had pain and yet they are telling me to go and buy pain killers for 1000 shillings to relieve the pain. I would suggest that we get the pain killers, or capsules like dicrophenac or panadol, like if we are given a tin of panadol tablets such that a patient can go when he/she has the pain killers and the guidance on how to use them alongside olive oil if they have wax, other than someone saying they examined me but I didn't get any treatment yet I have pain, now like the patient I referred to Allan, up to now he says the ears are still itching, he is using olive oil and he will be washed out tomorrow. Or if there is medicine which can be used to reduce itching in the ear, they should be given to us so that we are sure that we have tackled the problems of ears because you told us that if a person has itching in the ear, leave him or without wax, so shall we leave the person to use sticks because we have no where else to reffer them, I request Doctor James to make that improvement, that's what I think and also my colleagues that I work with.

It could be the sign of an early skin infection in the ear canal. If the ear canal is very red that might be a sign of infection. 3. It could be caused by a skin problem 4.

Don't we have any other medicine that works more than olive oil? Because that wax brings problems like ringing in the ears and itching so even if you give olive oil and do the washout, the issue remains, also about the eyes, people between the age of 60 and above also complain about ears and we find many of them who have pain of the eyes. Is there any help we can give them? Because some may not have ear problems but complain about eyes and yet you don't have the medicine, how can we help such people we need knowledge about this. Thank you.",

When I travel on a pick up too and I get affected by too much wind, I feel pain in my ears. It feels like piercings inside and around the ear.

Or if someone pours water on you at once without doing it slowly, you still experience pain. Now the speed of the car is the reason as to why you feel that way but if it's slow, you can't experience it. I don't think there's any other cause.",

This will be the same as the last meeting with Dr. Doreen where your patients with problems can be reviewed. Finally, Dr. Doreen has agreed to operate on patients for free in Mbarara. She can do one patient per week. I know Mbarara is a long distance however they will be guarenteed to be see by her, it will be on a set date meaning they can plan for the journey and they can be rest assured that they will receive all treatment for free.",

The training you promised us from Dr Daniel who is coming from Mbarara and those who are coming on 29th. I request all those who have patients to be seen to inform them so they can be reviewed on that day. Thanks so much supervisor. May god reward you in everything. For caring for us in every way. May god provide you for everything you put your hand in. One more thing I call my upon my fellow VHTs to teach the patients very well. When we talk about oil we don't mean the oil for cars, because someone asked me whether they said can it be any oil e.g. cars, bodas. So the person said I have some oil in my jerry can at home. So I asked them which kind of oil and they said that for bodas. So the patient was wondering if we should use that one. So I told them do not put that in the ear. I told them, we put another kind of oil and we are the only ones to have it and give you directions about how to use it. The one you are talking about can bring harm to the ear. It is not meant for the ear, it is meant for automobiles. I request all the VHTs to inform the people. Tell them exactly what type of oil to use. I wish you a good day but as a reminder we have a meeting at 2pm at the HC today. I request all who have heard to inform a friend. ",

Covering her - feeding her and also giving her body building foods that can't be affected with the disease so the white blood cells can get more energy.

I would like us to work together whether one received a file or not. The reason I am saying that is because some people received files with people they didn't treat or who don't stay in their areas. If someone sends a name of a person from their file that they didn't treat or who don't stay in their area, the one who knows them should help and direct that person. Today someone else may be having a file but next time it will be you. I suggest we work together to make this work easy because it's 30th and almost June. It will be bad if we look for those people without finding them yet someone who could be knowing them just didn't let us know. An example is yesterday when Herbert asked who knew the patients he listed down. I am not sure if you sent him a private message because I haven't seen anyone directing him. I therefore suggest we work together so we can finish the work that was given to us. This is not about only those who got the file but everyone. I will be happy if we help each other and do this work very fast.",
