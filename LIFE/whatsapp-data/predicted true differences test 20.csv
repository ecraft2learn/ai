Mobile phone	Case study - response	Mobile phone	Greetings	Religion	Thanks	NA	CHW	Group	"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. I thank our bosses Andrew, Catherine, Bryan and Hannah for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. I have also just seen the question because my phone has been having a fault since yesterday when Bryan updated WhatsApp. Honestly I had given up on it. It wasn't showing anything not even any name. There were only two groups remaining and that's it seeta Nazigo and VHT. In the photo I can see someone with a hole on the ear at the front not the back. I can see that it's okay. Normally if it is not an infection, most people are born with it. May be when they get it after they've grown up due to infections but this one to me looks like the person was born with it and has no problem. I remember we were told during the training that it's called pre-auricular sinus. If it has a problem I refer the person to specialists because I can't do anything about it. If it has no problem I encourage them telling them it has no problem and to feel free like me. Also not to worry that it could cause hearing loss. Thanks so much."

Mobile phone	Case study - response	Peer-to-peer learning	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW 	Group	I think my phone is not clear but what I am seeing is brown stuff and the light of the otoscope. I said I wasn't seeing anything because a brown color is all I could see. Now I don't know whether a reddish ear drum is brown or red because that's what my phone is showing. I would like to see how it appears in your phones.
Peer-to-peer problem solving	Reporting	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Request	Greetings	NA	NA	Peer supervisor 	Group	"Greetings members. I have an issue. I have two children. The mother told me in the first 3 months the child had pus in the ear - they treated it, it got normal. Then 6 months later it came back. But right now the child is 4 years and the pus has come back. Right now the child does not have pus - but if you stand at the back of the child the child does not hear. So instead you have to stand infront of the child otherwise the child will not hear you. But behind they do not hear. So I need help about this child. I also have another one who is the elder of this one - 6 years old. They are girls. They also told me they have a similar problem - they used to have pus, the mum put warm water and would drain it from the ear which meansthe child never got antibiotics.  I examined and didn't see any pus but wax and itching. So I need your advice what can I do? Bryan and Catherine I need your advice as I fill the forms - because if they need antibiotics I don't have them right now. But I will do what is possible and let you know. Thank you so much. "
Management of a patient	Case study - feedback	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator 	Group	Hi vhts so the correct answer is that this is an infected preauricular sinus. It needs to be referred for incision and drainage at the health centre. They also need appropriate antibiotic tablets and they eventually will need to go to mukono HC4 to have the sinus removed to prevent the infection from happening again. It is not otitis externa

Greetings	Case study - logistics	Greetings	Thanks	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator 	Group	 Good morning VHTs. Did you have a good weekend? Thanks for all your work. We are now back to our cases which we always have after 2 weeks. 
Case study - response	Reporting	Management of a patient	Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	Group	"Greetings VHTs - thanks for todays work. Today I managed to visit my houses. I found a boy of 20 years. One ear has a hearing loss, after the ear got a problem after using quinine tablets when he was still young. It affected his ear when I looked into the ear. It looks like he has a problem with the ear drum. I didn't manage to do a washout, because I didn't have the equipment to do dry mopping. "

Request	Management of a patient	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Greetings	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Group	Good morning. Perhaps  if someone actively has an ear problem and comes to you to seek help see them and treat them. However the reason I asked to remain with just makata seeta kavuule and kirujja was so you arent over whelemed with people. If they are in seeta nazigo parish though its ok to see as this is the area we have ethical clearance for. What do you guys think?
Case study - information	Case study - feedback	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Group	"The VHT should explain to him that to confirm the hearing loss they would need to refer him to a specialist called an audiologist who can test his hearing using special tests. Unfortunately however, there are not many audiologists in Uganda. The ones that are there are expensive and only in Kampala. There are some treatments for hearing loss like hearing aids and cochlear implants but these are also expensive. A hearing aid costs 6 million shillings for one, and the batteries need changing each week. Each battery costs 20,000 shillings. 

There are other things that the VHT can recommend. For young children with hearing loss they can go to special schools for the deaf for example. Here they can learn sign language and communicate. They can also give advice such as wearing ear protection to prevent hearing loss in the first place if they are exposed to loud noises in their job, or avoiding medicines which can cause hearing loss. 

The VHT can also explain to family members how to communicate with someone who struggles to hear properly. For example, speaking slowly, clearly and loudly. Not covering the mouth with the hand when talking to someone. Pointing to objects they are referring to. Being patient.

If a baby has two parents who are deaf they should spend time with family members who are not deaf as this can otherwise affect their language development. 

Remember people who are deaf have normal intelligence. "
