Peer-to-peer problem solving	Reporting	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Peer supervisor 	Group	"Greetings members. I have an issue. I have two children. The mother told me in the first 3 months the child had pus in the ear - they treated it, it got normal. Then 6 months later it came back. But right now the child is 4 years and the pus has come back. Right now the child does not have pus - but if you stand at the back of the child the child does not hear. So instead you have to stand infront of the child otherwise the child will not hear you. But behind they do not hear. So I need help about this child. I also have another one who is the elder of this one - 6 years old. They are girls. They also told me they have a similar problem - they used to have pus, the mum put warm water and would drain it from the ear which meansthe child never got antibiotics.  I examined and didn't see any pus but wax and itching. So I need your advice what can I do? Bryan and Catherine I need your advice as I fill the forms - because if they need antibiotics I don't have them right now. But I will do what is possible and let you know. Thank you so much. "
Case study - response	Acknowledgement	Greetings	CHW	Group	 I have seen all the messages my fellow VHTs. Those sympathising with me about my disease plus advice on how to use our groups. Thank you so much. Good night.
Case study - response	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Management of a patient	CHW	Peer supervisor	"Greetings Edward, me too my idea is not so different from my fellow friend's views, give him olive oil on the er with wax and then some pain killers for pain. Thank you for your work."
Peer-to-peer problem solving	Logistics	Reporting	CHW	Peer supervisor	"Edward, I apologize for using this platform. That patient reached my place and I have also seen what you have written. She says when she got there they removed an insect out of his ear but before that they had examined and seen wounds instead. I haven't given him any treatment because I don't have any supplies. I had sent him to Gordon but she says it's too late so he will return the following day."
Case study - response	Case study - asking a question	NA	CHW	Group	"I have a concern as Gordon. When you talk to patients about allergies, they don't understand. What is allergy? Does it mean changes in the body? I'd like to know it in our language. "
Case study - logistics	Encouragement	NA	Facilitator 	Group	Did any vhts do a video recording today ? If so please send it to us on this group
Case study - feedback 	Management of a patient	Peer-to-peer problem solving	CHW	CHW	"Well done Isabella, what you need to do for that patient according to what we were told in the meeting, you have to do it like Nora has explained to you, do another washout, because the ear might be having a wound so you need to do a washout of about three times, then you give antibiotics, then you give her some pain killers to reduce on the pain, that is my suggestion."
Case study - asking a question	Logistics	Reporting	CHW	Group	And now fellow VHTs I have reached Mrs. Xs place. But her ear is so bad. One is very very bad. The left one has pus doesn't look good. Tomorrow Andrew will see her when he goes for the home visit.

Case study - asking a question	Logistics	Peer-to-peer problem solving	CHW	CHW	Well done Isabella. Welcome back from the church service. What are we going to do about Miss X? I haven't got a reply yet. I was suggesting we fix some time tomorrow evening and give her some antibiotics because of the wounds so she can get some peace. How do you see?

Case study - logistics	Thanks	NA	Facilitator 	Group	Thank you very VHTs for those who have replied on todays case. 
Case study - feedback 	Management of a patient	Peer-to-peer problem solving	CHW	CHW	"Well-done Isabella, thanks for the work you are doing, sorry about that patient I think the days we were told for the ENT doctor who is coming are close therefore you can do as Hadijja had said as we wait for the doctor may be on 29th in case it doesn't work then she has to see the specialist if the antibiotics can't work because her ear problem might be worse because in most cases she can't hear and when you talk to her on the side of the ear which has a problem she can't hear you, I don't know whether she was seen by a specialist last time, but this time she has to see them otherwise if she needs surgery as we were given chance, she can go to Mbarara after being examined by the specialists."

Case study - response	Management of a patient	Peer-to-peer problem solving	CHW	Group	"Greetings my fellow VHTs, am Kizza Isabella, I want to inquire from other VHTs, Bryan, Catherine and  Doctor, my client called Namugga Lydia who had pus in the ear, we had give her antibiotics after a washout and she was feeling okay, but right now she came to me saying she had a bad night with too much pain in the ear and also too much pus, so am asking what can I do, I need your help, because I was thinking may be we give her some pain killers because she feels too much pain. Am waiting for your response, I am here with the patien"
Request	Reporting	Management of a patient	CHW 	Facilitator	"Greetings Bryan, for the work you're doing. I have a client with a perf and pus, they need the medicine. Please send me the medicine for this. I will take a photo of the child. "
Case study - information	Logistics	Request	Facilitator 	Group	Also who needs a MUAC tape still ? We have 4 VHTs who have not got one yet - however we bought one for every VHT. Please come to the organisation to collect your tape off Bryan or Catherine this week. I will leave them with a supply for those VHTs who did not get one.
Case study - response	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Greetings	CHW 	Group	"Greetings again. I sent the message but it took awhile to be successfully sent because of data issues and I apologize for that. This is what I have to say about today's question. I have a challenge of not having medicine for certain illnesses like wounds and pus. We don't have that. There's a lady I once told Bryan about who has so many wounds in the ear but I have been unable to take her photo. I have tried looking for her but she went to the garden. She's elderly. Also Anna, she still has pus. Sometimes she gets well but when she travels she gets the pus again. I have been unable to find her too because I am sort of occupied but I am sorry. Regards to you all and I wish you a good day. May God be with you."
Logistics	Thanks	Encouragement	Facilitator	Group	Thanks very much those who have given me all your different ideas about todays cases. You have given good ideas indeed.

Therefore I REQUEST that if there is something you wish to talk about you use the other WhatsApp group. Thank you very much and have a good night. 
Management of a patient	Peer-to-peer problem solving	NA	Peer supervisor 	CHW	The problem we have right now is we don't personally have the antibiotics - please be patient with us and we will get feedback from the omnimed supevisiors. Tell that patient to go to Omni Med on Monday. If not - maybe Bryan and Catherine will give us time on Monday. 
Case study - response	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Management of a patient	CHW	Peer supervisor	"Mr Edward, I have understood your case, but my suggestion is not so different from that of Dorothy, or you can refer the patient to the Health Centre to give him some medicine to reduce on the pain. That's my view."
Case study - feedback 	Management of a patient	Logistics	Facilitator	Facilitator	Ok the little spot I am not concerned about. I just thought the back of the tragus looked very swollen like mastoiditis. It sounds less concerning if he is generally ok. But let's go see him tomororrow.

Case study - response	Case study - feedback 	NA	Facilitator	Group	" Interesting. So you have to encourage people to challenge those who demand money. For example - everyone has a boss. Even the doctor at the health center.. their boss is the incharge, the incharges boss is the DHO... encourage people to know their rights as citizens and to challenge those who abuse power. Get them to take their name and registration number. Then report this to LC1 and HC in-charge in formal writing, keeping a copy for yourself which can be used as evidence."
Case study - response	Case study - information	Greetings	Facilitator 	Group	"Morning VHTs. Here is a new case study. Case: On a home visit you see a child, Joyce Nakosi, who is 3 years old. The mother says that for the past two days the child has been crying, feverish, irritable and has a respiratory tract infection. They have been coughing a lot and sleeping poorly. You take the history from the mother and said says that the child has been tugging at their right ear like they are in pain, but do not have any discharge coming from the right ear. The left ear is ok.

You look in the ear with your otoscope and the ear drum (tympanic membrane) looks like this: "
