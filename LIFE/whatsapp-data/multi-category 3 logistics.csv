Thank you for your advice."

It was part of the case series questions much as there are some patients who move from one VHT to another it was not the case for that. That is why the dates are all the same!

-40	-34	2	17	1	3	0	54	Facilitator	Thanks for the reply. To answer Edwards point about itching ears. Itching of the ears can be caused by many things. 1. It can actually be caused by putting sticks or cotton buds into the ear... the sticks inflame the ear canal even more and keep the cycle of itching going. 2. It could be the sign of an early skin infection in the ear canal. If the ear canal is very red that might be a sign of infection. 3. It could be caused by a skin problem 4. It could be caused by a lot of wax.

And if yes, doesn't it affect someone when the pus hides somewhere in the ear? Can't the pus go through the mouth and accidentally someone eats it and gets another problem? Am still wondering about this and it confuses me whereby I need to learn more, and lastly the holes in the ear drum, how are they caused?"

Personally when I take a walk in coldness especially in the morning, my whole body itches and sometimes my tongue swells. But again you have said your pinna hurts and you experience itching. I think if you feel that way again, you should go for a check up immediately. You never know what kind of disease it could be. I suggest you see someone when you're still feeling like that.  You may be having an infection that worsens in such conditions.That's what I think dear."

Some VHTs are not replying to cases for example like yesterday, I encourage you to respond to the cases and answer the question the way you understand it, because even if you are not right still in the evening we get the right answer, I also encourage you that whenever we get the answers let's go back to ours notes and remind ourselves about the issues we are learning about. I have understood that there is a book which will be put to show the way people respond to cases, so I don't know whether it will be showing the Marks and our performance, so I advise you all to be active. Another thing I am not sure about is whether Qiana receives her phone back but to those who have their phones, please let us use them to share ideas so that we can take this project ahead also to make our representatives happy, I know they were so upset yesterday. I wish you a good day."

The staff at Omni Med have told me that this afternoon they need to use the car since their car is broken. I will therefore not have a car after 2pm so will not be able to drive to kirujja butoke today.  I am sorry for the disruption Qiana and Jane. I am able to see patients around makata this afternoon instead and can go with you tomorrow at 2pm and then Oliver and Luke at 4pm.

-33	33	2	25	1	8	0	0	CHW	"Well-done my fellow VHTs, when you don't hear about me please it is because the phone has no power and also the time I take it to the charger, sometimes the power is off, also as you see the weather, it is difficult to charge on solar since the sunshine is little. So I had left the phone on charge on Monday yet the power was off during that time, those are my words Catherine and Bryan thanks for the work you are doing and to all the health workers wherever you are, thanks for the job you are doing for the nation. God bless you."
-38	34	2	31	1	5	0	2	CHW	"Greetings Edward, about that issue as I said, its better to work together as team, if there are VHTs who will not be able to come this side due to distance, we who are nearer  can work as team like those around Seeta, Kavule and Makata. Unlike those who are so far like Qiana and Jane. Thank you"

The truth is if that hole doesn't pain the person, there is no problem, but if it pains the patient, then you have to refer the patient to Catherine and Bryan at Omni Med and if it is swollen still you have to take it to the specialist or Catherine and Bryan, that is my suggestion."

Also his main problem was the insect we removed from his ears but he doesn't have any other problem that needs treatment. We referred him to you because we didn't know he comes from Kavule.

-24	90	3	45	1	12	2	33	Facilitator	"For the benefit of you guys. Luke found a patient yesterday on a home visit with a very bad infection of the leg. The patient was going to stay at home but we advised them to go to Mukono District Health Center 4 in town and be seen by the doctors. This is important as the infection was very bad and the woman could die if this spread to the bone. Some were worried about the doctors wanting to ask for money. Remember that the government health centers are free. Anyone who asks for money should be directly challenged and the patient should take the doctors name. They should report this to you as VHT and you report to OmniMed. We will then make sure this is seen to by the District Health Officer Dr. Tumashabe. Remember, VHTs are the voice of the people. "

-71	139	3	88	2	34	1	17	CHW	Good morning fellow VHTs. I have some information here thsat I want you to spread. They are saying that every VHT needs to make a report that they need to present at the end of month to show you are active. All VHTs - not just ones part of the ear project. The information is coming from the MoH and District. We will also have a meeting every month at Seeta Nazigo HC. Please let all of your friends know. Bryan you said we would be meeting at the health centre - are you still coming?
-139	139	3	71	2	3	1	65	CHW	"Greetings my fellow VHTs. Those of you from treating patients at the born again church, I welcome you back and thanks for the work you have done. Now personally I have a patient I worked on, went to her place, got to the stage of putting oil in her ears and then gave her an appointment to wash them on Friday. On that day she pretended and went away so I didn't find her there but saw her the following day on Saturday. When I asked her why she was no where to be seen, she said she had gone to Seeta. I told her since she goes to the born again church in makata I would do the ear wash out from there to which she objected. However, much as I saw her today she pretended and went away without me working on her. I am going to give up on her because I don't want to force her. Perhaps she doesn't want her ears treated. Also, there's a message Dr. Andrew sent us saying he will be with us on Monday at the health centre in Seeta but I'm not sure of the time. Those who are aware please let me know so  that I'm in position to keep time. Thanks."
