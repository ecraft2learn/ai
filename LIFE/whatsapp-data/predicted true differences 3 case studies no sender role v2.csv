Thanks for the work you're doing for us. When I see that picture I see a hole. That hole in most cases is congenital but sometimes it's an infection with discharge coming out of it. If it's just like that with nothing coming out, I encourage the person and tell them there's no problem. But if it has any damage I refer the person to a specialist for further examination. That's my reply to the question."

Thanks for all you have sacrificed to treat people. May God bless you. I am sorry for being silent but it's because I lost someone and just came back on Sunday night. I turned off data during the period and forgot to turn it on. I also had malaria, was so down and it's only yesterday that I got some energy to go to Seeta but I am sorry for not replying to the question on Monday and Tuesday. Now this is my answer to today's question. When the mother asks the cause of acute otitis media, I tell her the child's immunity is still very low. I also explain to her that the condition is temporary. Regards to you all and I wish you well as you answer the questions. Catherine, Andrew and Bryan, I am on my way coming. May God bless you."

When I check Enoch and the MUAC tape indicates he is severely malnourished, I advise the mother to take him to the health centre immediately since his condition is critical. The advice I can give the mother regarding the sister is to take good care of her by giving her body building food, energy giving food, drinks, milk and millet porridge since she ain't that badly off. All she needs is proper care. That's what I have to say today."

There is a house I have found a child. The boy is 10 years, but he is mentally disturbed. So I need your advice. Can I take the child to Andrew on Monday. I need advice because the child does not talk or hear - he is deaf. I need advice what can I do."
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - acknowledgement	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.

Supportive environment	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Well done Dorothy this is absolutely correct. Do all other VHTs agree? If you do you don't need to reply to the question as this is the correct answer.
Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Good morning fellow members. Thanks for today and yesterday's work. We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - logistics and planning	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	 If we can't see this person now Dorothy we should see them first thing in the morning
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - logistics and planning	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	Hi Andrew. Good morning. I have a patient we were going to see today. He has a hearing loss and a swelling of the pinna and it has a perforation like a sinus on it. So I told them we will meet in town.

Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - making a request	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Now I have a problem. There is a patient I have here. She is 80 yo lady, I gave her ear drops which she has been using. Today is the 5th day. I have washed the ear, but I have seen the wax is near the canal. It is so hard you can see it without putting the otoscope, so even if you put tissue papers they can't go in. I request for one of our helpers to come help me. "
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	NA	NA	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	"Or can I go and see the patient and I tell them to come on 4th of March, when I have known the condition the child is in."
Communication and information	Supportive environment - mutual learning	Communication and information - clarifying information	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"That's where I beg Andrew that most villages did not get VHTs but they have ear problems, what are we going to do? We kindly ask for a response and we see what next because there are many villages which have no VHTs but they have ear problems. What are we going to do because they have started approaching us since they know we were trained. "

Also, this lady called X who had pus from the ears kept complaining of pain but I asked her and she said she no longer feels it. She also said she can at least hear a few words when someone speaks. We shall go back and check on her. Another thing, there's also X. When you look at Monday's program, I would like Andrew to see him as well. Thanks and good night."

Thanks for the work you're doing. I can see an ear with a hole in today's photo. People have that hole with no pain at times and from what I see it's not painful. If it was painful the person needs to see doctors. That's my view. The hole is called a sinus.

Quality assurance	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - apology	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	Facilitator	Hi vhts. I am writing a diahorrea case today as per Harriet's request.  I am so sorry for delaying the case. I've just had a really busy few days. But I will send it to Catherine today and I'll be back in makata on Monday
Communication and information	Supportive environment - mutual learning	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW	 I would also like to correct Harriet. Brucella is not malaria but a disease of its own just like T.B.
Communication and information	Supportive environment - mutual learning	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW	It's true. One litre of water equals two cups of water not four.
