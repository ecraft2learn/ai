-29	-7	0	84	2	66	1	11	CHW	Well done Isabella. Welcome back from the church service. What are we going to do about Miss X? I haven't got a reply yet. I was suggesting we fix some time tomorrow evening and give her some antibiotics because of the wounds so she can get some peace. How do you see?

7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	CHW	"This is Patricia, VHT SN. I refer that child to a bigger HC. "
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	"Now, given Annette's condition the 50 year old lady from Makata, this is what I think could be the cause of her ears itching. Some people have skin diseases but because they don't feel pain, they don't bother treating them. Sometimes you find a child or adult with ringworms in the head, another with dandruff yet another may not be having any. She may be having a skin disease in the hair that may be affecting the ears when she tries to scratch it. Secondly, she may have used something that shouldn't be used in the ears like sticks, dirty water, medicine and others. I think that's what causes ears to itch."
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	"Our question is about a sick child called Patricia and the first question requires us to define diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is watery stool that's not as solid as the normal waste. It is identified when someone's stool is watery. Apart from drinking water that's not clean, other causes of diarrhoea include eating dirt, eating different food stuff at the same time, eating lots of fats that one ain't used to, eating unwashed mangoes and typhoid. That's my reply to the question."
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	CHW	What are you saying Luke?
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	CHW	"Todays question of the patient who had wax yesterday - I apply olive oil drops, 3 drops, 3 times a day, 5 days. Then after the 5 days I wash out with 9mls of H20 and 1 ml of iodine. I then dry mop those ears. If I do all that and the wax remains I put oil in the ears again and then wash out again after 5 days. If it remains again I refer the patient to a specialist. But the advice I give to that patient is not to insert sticks in to their ears - becuase this can affect the ear canal and ear drum. I also tell them that incase they get problems with their ears they should not self medicate. But they should see a health worker. "
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Facilitator	Ok Luke let others also give their views then we shall give you the causes of itching in the ear. 
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Facilitator	And this is wait a negative RDT looks like if the child does not have malaria
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	CHW	Ok Sir. 
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Facilitator	I will be at Seeta Nazigo on Monday to distribute payment for March. Remember that payment will be based on participation and number of reports submitted correctly.
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Facilitator	Yes... Checking the skin turgor (how strong it is is a good answer)
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Hi VHTs. Here are some suggestions about how to prevent diahorrea: Breastfeed more frequently when a baby has diarrhoea.

Give more fluids to children with diarrhoea.

Giving oral rehydration salts solution can strengthen a child and reduce the risk of death from diarrhoea.

Prevent diarrhoea by disposing of all faeces in a latrine 

Wash hands with soap before preparing or handling food, before eating or feeding a child. after using the toilet or changing a child who has defecated, before and after taking care of someone who is sick, after touching sick or dead animals

Use safe water for drinking and food preparation

Do not drink water from any source directly without boiling it 

Safe water can be made unsafe if carried in dirty containers or stored in dirty containers or left uncovered in clean containers

Protect water from contamination by covering water storage containers and keeping animals away.

Cook food well and protect it from flies.

Cover stored food.

Use clean eating utensils."
7	7	1	84	0	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	"Before I answer the question, I request Luke to send his audio again because his voice sounds very low and the person in the background is actually louder. Luke I am requesting you re send your audio please."
8	8	1	83	0	64	0	11	Facilitator	Hi Patricia - the information about this is in your handbook which you got at the training day in January. This Is called a 'post-auricular fistula'.
11	11	1	82	0	60	0	11	Facilitator	"Nora, if you see a VHT giving a wrong answer - please explain to them the right answer. "
12	12	1	82	0	59	0	11	Facilitator	"The VHT should explain to him that to confirm the hearing loss they would need to refer him to a specialist called an audiologist who can test his hearing using special tests. Unfortunately however, there are not many audiologists in Uganda. The ones that are there are expensive and only in Kampala. There are some treatments for hearing loss like hearing aids and cochlear implants but these are also expensive. A hearing aid costs 6 million shillings for one, and the batteries need changing each week. Each battery costs 20,000 shillings. 

There are other things that the VHT can recommend. For young children with hearing loss they can go to special schools for the deaf for example. Here they can learn sign language and communicate. They can also give advice such as wearing ear protection to prevent hearing loss in the first place if they are exposed to loud noises in their job, or avoiding medicines which can cause hearing loss. 

The VHT can also explain to family members how to communicate with someone who struggles to hear properly. For example, speaking slowly, clearly and loudly. Not covering the mouth with the hand when talking to someone. Pointing to objects they are referring to. Being patient.

If a baby has two parents who are deaf they should spend time with family members who are not deaf as this can otherwise affect their language development. 

Remember people who are deaf have normal intelligence. "
15	15	0	37	1	61	0	9	Facilitator	 Excellent answer Dorothy.
16	16	1	82	0	56	0	10	Facilitator	"Todays case it also about filling in the books, so send photos like yesterday. "
17	17	1	81	0	54	0	10	CHW	"Now the advice I can give to the patient who had wax in their ears is to apply oilive oil in the ears. I do it for the first time, I tell her to apply it three drops, three times a day for 5 days. I do the washout after the five days, if I find there is still wax even after doing that, I refer to an ENT specialist. "
19	19	1	81	0	52	0	10	Facilitator	Ok
20	20	1	80	0	50	0	10	CHW	"When I find that three year old child Patricia with my supervisor and they tell me she has diarrhoea, this is my understanding of it. Diarrhoea refers to frequent release of watery stool. People in my community understand it as a condition when someone goes to the latrine frequently and believe it is caused when someone eats food they ain't used to like a lot of meat on festivals. Some people in the village hardly eat it due to low income so believe it causes diarrhoea. Other causes of diarrhoea include drinking unboiled water, eating contaminated food and other food stuff and typhoid. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea that I can talk about now. Those are my answers to today's questions."
21	21	1	80	0	49	0	10	CHW	Catherine there is a sound on my phone - like an alarm I don't know what to do. Maybe my phone has a problem? 
22	22	0	29	1	60	0	9	Facilitator	Thanks Isabella
5	25	1	74	0	59	2	10	CHW	 Got  a client with little wax but much Itcthing. We need your help.
26	26	1	79	0	44	0	9	CHW	The second question. I counsel the patient and I tell her to buy the medicine. And also take it in the prescribed time and also eating something before taking the medicine. Also not being so stressed. Because such things happen. Also I tell her about clinics where she can get the medicine. The different is she is the one to buy the medicine and I will get to know which day she will buy the medicine. That is my suggestion. 
29	29	0	21	1	59	0	9	Facilitator	Your answers are very good - thanks. 
29	29	0	21	1	59	0	9	Facilitator	"Thank you very much for those who have given answers but I have not heard fom the others. Dorothy, Patricia, Isabella, Matthew, Harriet ne Qiana. But let me hope you are ok we will be happy when we can hear from you. "
29	29	0	21	1	59	0	9	Facilitator	Great answer. Thanks for the insights
30	30	1	78	0	39	0	9	CHW	" First of all, I explain to Jamil that he ain't alone with that kind of problem. It might have been caused by growing up in a home where the children are slapped on the cheeks thus affecting the ears. Another cause could be suffering from malaria and being given quinine as treatment causing damage to the ears. Also, some people are born like that."
-160	30	2	84	0	65	1	11	CHW	"Andrew I have found a patient with pus in her ear, you told us that to give such a patient antibiotics we have to first consult you, what can I do? I beg for a reply ssebo"
31	31	1	78	0	39	0	8	CHW	"As for today's question concerning yesterday's gentleman, these are the causes of hearing loss I can give. First of all, diseases can affect ears causing hearing loss. Secondly, loud noises like bullet sounds can cause the problem too. Some people are born with abnormalities on the bones of hearing. Disabilities for example some teachers at schools slap students in the ears. In addition to that, violence in homes causing one partner to beat the other which may damage their ears and cause hearing loss. Using strong medicine like quinine. Lastly, old age though that gentleman is 37 which is not so old. That's my reply to today's question. I remain Gordon, VHT Makata."
32	32	1	78	0	38	0	8	CHW	"Sorry I had forgotte to give the name of the disease, but it is called otitis media. "
32	32	1	77	0	37	0	8	CHW	"I reached at 's place like three times but I didn't get her, today I was in Kaziba to do an ear washout to those people we gave olive oil while we were with doctor Andrew"
-154	34	2	83	0	60	1	11	Facilitator	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.
37	37	0	15	1	62	0	10	CHW	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for last week's work. Those with patients and who have lost loved ones may God be with you. I welcome back you all from the meeting at Seeta Nazigo. We thank God for bringing you to attend and I'm sure He has enabled you to reach safely.
37	37	0	15	1	62	0	10	Peer supervisor	Thanks good night. 
38	38	1	76	0	30	0	8	Facilitator	Harriet... They should be in the box I gave you
40	40	1	75	0	28	0	7	CHW	"The second question, children from poor communities are prone to chronic supprative otitis media because poor people don't receive enough health services. Others have little understanding on health issues. Lastly, I request the teachers to explain to us the meaning of the word allergy."
40	40	1	76	0	29	0	7	Peer supervisor	Ok let us wait 
40	40	0	15	1	66	0	11	Facilitator	Ok Mr. Karl. Thank you. 
41	41	1	75	0	27	0	7	Facilitator	Haha Ok. No problem 
41	41	0	15	1	67	0	11	Facilitator	Thanks for this 
42	42	1	75	0	26	0	7	Facilitator	"Karl asked ""Why is it that someone can get bitten by a mosquito and not suffer from malaria yet another one may? Also why do children under 5, pregnant women and those from western Uganda prone to malaria compared to other people? Karl. To answer your questions, some mosqitoes carry malaria Karl, others do not. Therefore one person might be bitten by a mosquito like the female anonphales which carries malaria, and the other person may be bitten by a male mosquito which does not carry it. Those in western Uganda have higher rates of malaria as the number of mosquitoes there are higher. Pregnant women and children have weakend immune systems compared to adults so are more likely to get malaria. Qiana asked  My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? Qiana, thank you. To answer your question: Although they might be sleeping under a net with no holes, they could have been bitten at any other point before they fall asleep. For example at dusk when they are collecting water. It only takes one bite to get malaria. Francesca asked My question is why does fatigue cause malaria? Francesca, malaria causes fatigue as you get fevers, get dehydrated from sweating and the body feels weak. Also it can damage the red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. Isabella asked ""They train them to do blood check ups for malaria. Is it possible with us too?"" Isabella - thank you for your enthusiasm. Right now we are not able to provide RDTs and medicine for malaria to the VHTs, since we only have a small amount of money. We think though that now you are aware that if a person presents to you with the symptoms of malaria you will know to advise them to get an RDT, check for malaria and refer them to the health centre to seek treatment if they require it. This is something you should ask the supervisors of Omni Med since they are the ones who are responsible for other disease except the ear. "
43	43	1	75	0	25	0	7	CHW	"This is my reply to the question too. What I can tell the mother is to feed that child with a balanced diet for example beans, soya, eggs if possible and others. Truth is children don't have white blood cells that fight against diseases. I explain that to the mother as well. And also ask her to cover their ears while bathing. That's my answer."
44	44	1	75	0	24	0	7	CHW	Catherine you were not clear about what I should do with that boy who can hear. So I will wait for a response tomorrow. 
44	44	0	16	1	72	0	12	CHW	Thank you Catherine for correcting us and letting us know what we have to do. God bless you. 
45	45	0	16	1	74	0	13	Facilitator	Excellent Patricia. Thank you. Very good answer.
47	47	1	74	0	21	0	6	Peer supervisor	After the 5 days I ask her to come back to do the washout. Part B. The advice I can give her is to keep applying the olive oil drops and not to insert anything into the ears like sticks. I also tell her not to use any medicine that has not been given to her by ear specialists. Lastly I advise to her come back for follow up to see how she is doing. 
49	49	1	74	0	19	0	6	CHW	"My answer to the question for day before. First introduce yourself to the mother of the child. Then you ask who the head of the house hold is. The age of the child. The village. Before asking her to examine the ear of the child, you enquire which ear has the problem. Whether it is one or both. After examining and you find the ear has a problem you give the child pain killers. You check again in 3 days. If there is no difference you refer the child. "
-87	49	0	19	2	59	1	9	Peer supervisor	"Thank you Edward, what I can say, the ear with wax needs olive oil and that with pain I think the person needs pain killers and we see how he will be. That is my idea."
49	49	1	74	0	19	0	6	CHW	 It's me Jane. I think the problem is in the inner ear and I refer her to specialists.
49	49	1	74	0	19	0	6	Peer supervisor	Now this is the reply to todays question. When I look in the ear I see so much pus I can't see the ear drum. This is called otitis media. 
51	51	1	75	0	18	0	6	Peer supervisor	"When I look at today's ear in the picture that has been given to us I see a hole behind the pinna. I remember they told us if the skin of the ear drum grew from inside, the behind part of the ear looks like that which is called cholesteatoma. That's what I see to day."
51	51	1	75	0	18	0	6	CHW	"B.As VHTs, we should keep teaching people how to take good care of their ears because hearing aids are expensive and learning sign language requires money too. They should therefore take care of their ears and see doctors as soon as they discover they  have any problem with them."
51	51	1	75	0	18	0	6	CHW	"I will start with the second question, the reason as to why people who are poor normally get chronic supprativr otitis media is that in most cases poor people have no money to take them to the Health centre to get assessment and also treatment, that's why they end up using sticks when they've got a lot of wax in their ears, some stay in pain not knowing even where to go to get help, now like a disease for sickle cells in some places they offer free treatment but because of lack of transport to take them where there is free treatment, they get affected. Therefore they lose hope, even in Seeta Nazigo Health Centre, they may be offering free dental services but a poor person even fails to get 5000 shillings to bring him or her for treatment which is not the case which the rich."
51	51	1	75	0	18	0	6	CHW	Friends I don't know what is happening to my phone. I have sent them twice but they are showing they have not gone through. 
51	51	1	75	0	18	0	6	CHW	"This is my reply to today's question. After seeing Mr. Jamil and confirming his ears have no other problem besides hearing loss, I explain to him what could be used to help him. I let him know about hearing aids and their cost which is between shs. 800,000 and shs.1,000,000. I also direct him to ENT specialists who sell them instead of just buying from anywhere like someone purchasing groundnuts or a phone. And that the ENT specialist must confirm it first."
53	53	1	76	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	You will refer to hospital but what if she doesn’t have money?
53	53	1	76	0	17	0	6	Peer supervisor	The ear canal is painful and full of pus 
53	53	1	76	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	Yes tomorrow it is Jane and Karl at 2pm meeting at makata Primary school. Please identify a house we can visit together.
53	53	1	76	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	Dorothy your answer to that question is right
53	53	1	76	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	"You ask her what symptoms she has had. She says she has had itching and some hearing loss in both ears. Please mark these in the book. You then look at the pinna which looks like this. Record your finding in the book. 
You then look in the left and right ear. They look like this. Please record the finding in your book. The hearing test was abnormal in both ears. Please record the finding in your book. Please then record your overall findings and plan in the book. 
"
53	53	1	76	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	Also who needs a MUAC tape still ? We have 4 VHTs who have not got one yet - however we bought one for every VHT. Please come to the organisation to collect your tape off Bryan or Catherine this week. I will leave them with a supply for those VHTs who did not get one.
54	54	1	77	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	"Those other things you mention such as eating half cooked meat are actually different diseases all together such as shigella, salmonella, ecoli"
36	54	0	15	1	60	2	9	Facilitator	Thanks very much Edward for those views because they are vey good. Continue encouraging pregnant women to go to the health centre like you said. 
54	54	1	77	0	17	0	6	CHW	"Gordon Byamukama, did you just move around? You should say you also examined. We haven't understood you really well. Did you move around and after went home or you examined and found no one had an ear problem? But you really didn't find anyone with a problem? Not even wax?"
54	54	1	77	0	17	0	6	CHW	"After washing the ears of the patient and finding out the wax is still there I do the wash out again, if I found out it is still there after washing out again I refer the patient to the specialist. "
54	54	1	77	0	17	0	6	Facilitator	The first case study. We shall give you the results after everyone has answered. 
54	54	1	77	0	17	0	6	Peer supervisor	The child I have examined - her mum told me she is 4 years. That is why I used the 6 month - 59 month MUAC. Another thing the mother didn't put her on the her legs as she could sit independantly. 
56	56	1	78	0	16	0	6	CHW	"Another part, which says should people buy their own medicines? The truth is when someone doesn'thustle to get something, they don't appreciate the value of that item. But for a person who has worked hard to get money to get something or to get money aperson will always be so careful about how to use that money. So the person will say I worked hard for this money so I can't play around. But if a person doesn't know where something came from they don't take any care or doesn't take any responsibility. Another thing - people who give you free medicine care about your life more than you. If you give it free its like you are forcing things on them - so let them love their live first. That is why they have to buy the medicine themselves so they know what it is like to go through to get the money. They need to know the cost of the medicine - if they don't know the cost they wil use it poorly. If they know it is 100,000 they will use it wisely.  "
56	56	1	78	0	16	0	6	Peer supervisor	I see the ear drum is reddish and has pus.
56	56	1	78	0	16	0	6	CHW	"Let me emphasise this. At the government health center there is some medicine that is not offered. Someone comes with a condition and sits from morning to evening. And later on when they see the health worker, they tell them they don't have that medicine and tell them to get it elsehwere. People think medicine is there, but it is just not there. "
57	57	1	79	0	16	0	6	Peer supervisor	I do ear wash out and dry mopping then I give 3 drops of antibiotics 3 times a day for 5 days and I the follow up.
57	57	1	79	0	16	0	6	Facilitator	QUESTION 3. The mother asks what treatment you could give the child. Tell us what you would do. 
57	57	1	79	0	16	0	6	Facilitator	After doing that then you can write in the book we gave you. 
57	57	1	79	0	16	0	6	CHW	It is caused by how we take care of our bodies. Poor hygiene is responsible for such conditions therefore it can lead to an infection like otitis externa.
57	57	1	79	0	16	0	6	CHW	"If I go back and find out the wax is still there. I repeat. I repeat the process of applying olive oil, three drops, three times a day. Then I wash out. If I go back and the wax is still there I refer the patient to an ENT specialist. In a bigger hospital. "
59	59	1	79	0	14	0	6	Facilitator	 If we can't see this person now Dorothy we should see them first thing in the morning
60	60	1	82	0	15	0	7	CHW	c) I ask their age
60	60	1	81	0	15	0	6	Facilitator	This is todays question. 
60	60	1	82	0	15	0	7	CHW	All VHTs are doing fine only that some of them are busy in their gardens.
60	60	1	81	0	15	0	6	CHW	There's the female anopheles mosquito
60	60	1	81	0	15	0	6	CHW	 I refer that patient to ENT specialists.
-99	61	2	74	0	19	1	6	CHW	"There is a question I am asking my fellow VHTs. There is a house I have found a child. The boy is 10 years, but he is mentally disturbed. So I need your advice. Can I take the child to Andrew on Monday. I need advice because the child does not talk or hear - he is deaf. I need advice what can I do."
61	61	1	82	0	15	0	6	Peer supervisor	"I explain to him that the treatment he can have may consist of surgery or hearing aids, but that can only be determined by a specialist. I direct him to that specialist."
-98	64	2	75	0	17	1	6	Facilitator	"There is no indication for antiobiotics if its itching . only pus, perforation and otitis externa"
65	65	1	86	0	14	0	7	CHW	"My third question - after seeing that the equipment is expensive I encourage them and advise them that there are technical schools, where they can go and learn. Because even the teachers who teach them use sign language. So that way they can develop themselves instead of staying the same when they don't know anything. Yet in those technical schools some do craft work, weaving baskets. They also teach them as people who hear. They also have a chance and an opportunity because those people train in construction, carpentry sand many more. They can be trained in sign language - a bit like the blind with braille.Because the blind can't see but they have special equipment. So the same applies to the deaf.

I have washed the ear, but I have seen the wax is near the canal. It is so hard you can see it without putting the otoscope, so even if you put tissue papers they can't go in. I request for one of our helpers to come help me. "

75	75	2	16	1	71	0	12	Facilitator	Thank you Karl . This is excellent advocacy work and great citizenship.
78	78	2	27	1	60	0	9	Facilitator	VHTs we are very greatful for all your replies this week. All of you have given very good views. Please continue to share ideas and help people with hearing loss in your communities in the ways you have mentioned. We are done with the questions for this week. Have a good night.

87	87	1	75	2	18	0	6	CHW	It is common among children because they are unable to acquire anything they need unlike adults. Children only depend on their parents. They are also weak and ignorant of what's important for them. May God be with you.

We kindly ask for a response and we see what next because there are many villages which have no VHTs but they have ear problems. What are we going to do because they have started approaching us since they know we were trained. "
-69	89	1	15	2	64	3	10	Facilitator	Patricia - well done! Great video. All of the steps you did were correct. Fantastic. Please feel free to show these videos or share them with other community members on your home visits. They are great.

114	114	1	79	2	44	0	9	CHW	"Well done health workers. Symptoms like not urinating, passing out stool all those times and sunken eyes are all very dangerous when a child has diarrhoea. We immediately mix ORS and ask the mother to give it to the child until they get to the health centre. I refer them to the health centre because I don't have treatment for the condition."
118	118	1	80	2	47	0	9	Facilitator	Good point. The cause of CSOM is due to poor hygiene sometimes so encourage parents to keep their childrens ears clean and dry.

137	137	1	82	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Greetings fellow VHTs and well done! That child has a pre-auricular sinus. As a VHT, I would advise them to get pain killers and also refer them to specialists. Thank you."

139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. When I check Enoch and the MUAC tape indicates he is severely malnourished, I advise the mother to take him to the health centre immediately since his condition is critical. The advice I can give the mother regarding the sister is to take good care of her by giving her body building food, energy giving food, drinks, milk and millet porridge since she ain't that badly off. All she needs is proper care. That's what I have to say today."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Good morning VHTs. Hope you are ok. Todays question concerning malaria is as follows: The RDT shows she has malaria. How do you treat malaria in this girl? 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Thanks all of you who responded about todays photo. We have given you the right answer above. The hole is called preauricular sinus, someone can have it without a problem. But if it is swollen the patient might need antibiotics or a referral such that a specialist can remove the pus or a surgery such that it doesn't think pus again or any other problem. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs. I can see a swelling on the pinna. Such conditions become serious if you don't attend to them early. If I see such a patient, I refer them to a specialist because they need surgery and as soon as possible."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Thanks VHTs - the correct answer is that because Enochs measurement using the tape showed 'Red' you should refer him urgently to the health centre for thorough assessment. Similarly, for his sister; Refer. Any child with swollen feet on both sides should be referred to the health centre. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	Greetings fellow health workers. I think what causes malaria is the female anopheles mosquito.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs. Thank God who has enabled us to wake up alive. This is my answer to today's question. If they come to me after getting checked and confirming they have malaria, I give them coartem three tablets in the morning then more three after 12 hours. That is done for three days. In those three days I accompany those tablets with one panadol twice a day because malaria causes pain in the body and headache. Panadol therefore acts as a pain killer that relieves pain in this case but coartem is the real medication for malaria. I also advise them to take a lot of drinks like passion juice, ORS and others. Some think drinks refer to alcohol so they go to bars and buy it claiming the doctor told them to do so and buy alcohol for themselves! They have to be soft drinks so clariy this for those drunk fathers!"
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Well-done all my fellow VHTs, this phone sometimes disturbs me with network, and I had no batery, when I look at that patient, I think that is chloestoma I just refer the patient to the ENT without delay, nice time."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers. This is my answer to today's question. Diarrhoea is a condition when a child releases more stool than they are meant to in a day. The stool is watery unlike the normal solid one and is released frequently. It is also the reason the child loses energy in their body. Diarrhoea is caused by many things including typhoid, eating dirty things like food contaminated by houseflies, uncovered left over food, dirty mangoes and sugarcanes picked on the way and not washing hands after going to the toilet. People in my community understand diarrhoea that it is when a child releases waste frequently, loses body energy and have watery stool."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	I also greet you all but I don't have MUAC tape. I am like Isabella. I don't know where I will find it. Was it something in South Africa where they isolate people. I don’t know why some of us didn’t get it. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. The way I see that child, I have no treatment for her condition as a VHT. I am not a qualified health worker therefore can't be permitted to treat her. The advice I can give to the mother is to take the child to a big health centre immediately. I can go ahead and escort her as well because her child's health is in danger at that moment. That's my reply to today's question."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thank you very much those who have answered todays question. When you look in the ear you can see the ear drum has a perforation and there is pus. The disease the boy has is called CSOM. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers. I am sorry I haven't been online but God who is above all has enabled me to be on now. I would like to thank Andrew for adding me back. About the child, I can tell they have malaria even after the mother explaining to me their symptoms by referring them to a big health centre for further examination. There are about two types of malaria I can think of. It could be the one transmitted by mosquitoes or typhoid. If it is malaria, I request for the results from the health centre for confirmation. I know at seeta nazigo health centre they treat it. As long as the patient comes suspecting it could be malaria, I just refer them for blood check up. I also advise them to avoid the following. Tall grass around the house, stagnant water and have to ensure the child sleeps under a treated mosquito net. If it's typhoid, I still refer them and advise them to boil drinking water, use clean utensils and cover their food. Have a good day."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Greetings to you all VHTs. All the symptoms show she is dehydrated therefore I give her first aid of ORS. I can mix the ORS and give it to Patricia's mother. I then advise her to give it to Patricia as she takes her to the health centre. When she gets to the health centre, I may have written the referral form for the nurses to see what the problem is. If not, I escort them and explain it to the nurses so they can put the child on drip immediately."
-161	139	2	84	1	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thanks for your participation VHTs. Keep the answers coming like Herbet said. We will provide the correct answers in the morning.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Good morning fellow members. Thanks for today and yesterday's work. We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for all the work you're doing for the country. Thanks for all you have sacrificed to treat people. May God bless you. I am sorry for being silent but it's because I lost someone and just came back on Sunday night. I turned off data during the period and forgot to turn it on. I also had malaria, was so down and it's only yesterday that I got some energy to go to Seeta but I am sorry for not replying to the question on Monday and Tuesday. Now this is my answer to today's question. When the mother asks the cause of acute otitis media, I tell her the child's immunity is still very low. I also explain to her that the condition is temporary. Regards to you all and I wish you well as you answer the questions. Catherine, Andrew and Bryan, I am on my way coming. May God bless you."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Good morning fellow workers  the picture shows me the disease called  fungal otitis  external.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Greetings to you all. My name is Gordon. Now if I find that lady Annette from Makata with itching ears and she insists on me giving her antibiotic drops yet on examining there was no problem inside, I don't give them to her. I refer her to a bigger hospital for examination. We looked at some of the causes of itching yesterday like fungal infections, too much heat and too much wax. I cannot give her any medication but rather refer her. That's what I have to say. It's me Gordon from Makata."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Good morning my brothers and sisters. Thanks for the work you're doing. We thank God for the rain today. Greetings Catherine and Bryan. How are you Andrew? How's everything? Thank God who has kept you while there. I have seen today's question and this is my reply. If I examine and find no problem like wax, pus or even a hole, it means the skin has an infection. Another reason is some people have allergies and may not be aware. Ears react faster than any other body part. That's my reply. It's either allergy or a skin infection. Rubbing them to ease the itching is also another one. The more someone does it, the more it itches. Thank you."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Good morning VHTs and thanks for the work. This case is focussed on malnutrition in children.

By the end of the case you should be able to:

1.	Define malnutrition (Monday)
2.	Know the importance and causes of malnutrition (Monday) 
3.	Recognise the signs of malnutrition in a child  (Tuesday) 
4.	Know how to use a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tape to assess a child for malnutrition (Wednesday) 
5.	Know the basic management plan for a child with suspected malnutrition identified in the community (Thursday)
6.	Know the important health messages they can give to caregivers to about nutrition (Friday) 

Case: You are on a home visit in Kavuule with your supervisor. At this house there is a 8 month old baby boy, Enoch. You are worried that he looks very thin and want to assess him for malnutrition. 

A.	What do you understand by the term malnutrition? B.	What are other words or terms for malnutrition in the community? C.	Why is malnutrition in childhood a problem? D.	What are some of the reasons and causes why a child might be malnourished? 
"
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings my fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work. It's been awhile since we last communicated but it's because I had gone to visit a patient somewhere. My reply to today's question is, that disease called cholesteatoma is one we can't tamper with. In case I confirm she has it, I immediately refer her to an ENT surgeon. I see her ear doesn't look well. When I look inside it has pus, and a perforation of the ear drum. That patient needs a washout. After washing out I give antibiotics. Then I do follow up. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	"Good morning members. Thanks for the work we have started doing today. That lady Annette, we discovered yesterday she has itching in the ear, so we were told that sometimes itching comes because of some bacteria in the body. But in all situations there is no way that antibiotics are recommended for this. So if they are so hard on me and want antibiotics I refer them to the specialist. Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me. Then I inform her - let those people examine you but if they find a problem in you I will see if you can get medicine but right now I don;t have the medicine for you. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Good morning VHTs - here is the third part of the case. You ask Patricias mother the questions. She tells you she has had diahorrea for 3 days, with 5 stools in the last 24 hours. She is tired, has not passed much urine. When you examine her her eyes are sunken and she has a dry mouth. 

Question: How do you want to treat her?"
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Well done Dorothy this is absolutely correct. Do all other VHTs agree? If you do you don't need to reply to the question as this is the correct answer.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Greetings ladies and gentlemen and thanks for the work. I am called Isabella Kizza. I think that patient might have been affected while still young for example    with malaria or yellow fever. When I examine him and I find he has that problem, I refer him to a specialist. Thanks."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"I am sorry someone called and my message was cut short. What I wanted to ask since I am not sure is what time we shall be meeting on Thursday. I am able to communicate now because someone helped me with the phone but it loses WhatsApp and blocks everything I try to do. Like I told you, Andrew and Bryan repaired it when we were at the health centre but it still bothers me that's why I am unable to reply to the questions. Thanks so much though for advising us. It's me your fellow health worker Johnson Matthew."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings to you all. Just like my fellows, diarrhoea at home can be prevented by mothers encouraging their children to wash their hands before eating anything and after visiting the latrine. They should also avoid eating dirty things like unwashed mangoes, defecate in latrines and not anywhere else, drink boiled water and also cover food to prevent it from contamination by cockroaches."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Ok Francesca, thank you. "

139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings ladies and gentlemen. Thanks Catherine for the work you're doing. For today's picture this is my reply. Most times people are born with that hole because my child has it too on both ears but it has no problem. But incase I find someone with it and with discharge or itching, I advise them to buy antibiotic tablets in order to ease the pain. That hole is called pre auricular sinus. Many people have it but it has no problem. That's what I have to say about today's photo."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Now for today's question of Annette asking for treatment for her itching ears, I personally refer her to the health centre to get pain killers. They can also examine her and if they have no medicine for her problem, they can write it down for her to get it from any pharmacy. If she insists on getting antibiotics I explain to her that I examined her ears and there's nothing like pus or perforations. Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication. I strengthen her and advise her to go to the health centre for medicine that can stop that itching. In case they don't have it, she can get it from the pharmacy after them writing it down. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Greetings fellow VHTs. Please continue praying for me. You know the illness of my leg is not so easy. I can't rush and complete my work. Thanks for praying for me. God might heal me. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for today's work. Thank Andrew, Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. This is my answer to today's question. I can honestly see a hole behind the ear. That hole is in most cases caused by a disease from poor hygiene whereas some are born with it. It's like cholesteatoma. The way the hole is formed is like...I think they call it post auricular. That's how I see it. In such a case, this is how I handle the patient. I encourage them to maintain cleanliness and to visit the health centre earlier before it gets to the bone. Once it gets to the bone it may cause damage to the brain leading to diseases like cancer. That's how I've answered today's question."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs. I have also seen the question and thank my fellows who have already answered. The questions I can ask the mother include....if she has given the child ORS or fluids and if she has taken her to the health centre. The symptoms of dehydration I can look out for are body weakness. Actually the person can hardly stand and appears like they are dizzy. Secondly, the child has sunken eyes. Others include dry skin, low appetite, heavy eyes and can neither lift their legs nor handle anything with their hands due to body weakness. Those are some of the symptoms."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Please forgive me. I didn't reply to the question because my battery was dead. I have the solar charger but there was no sunshine. By the time I checked it was too late for me to answer. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs everywhere in our villages. I am Isabella Kizza. When I check the 50 year old lady called Annette and find no problem besides itching for 5 months, I first advise her not to use sticks to ease the itching. I can also refer her to specialists. That's my reply"
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	Good morning fellows wherever you're. Thanks for the work you're doing. I can see an ear with a hole in today's photo. People have that hole with no pain at times and from what I see it's not painful. If it was painful the person needs to see doctors. That's my view. The hole is called a sinus.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs and our bosses. Bryan, Catherine, Hannah. Greetings to you all. Thanks for the questions. I apologise for not replying to the question yesterday. I was so busy. But this is my reply to todays question. For that patient who has wax I explain to them that you have wax and I am going to do a washout and then she will have our medicine of olive oil. I give her the olive oil and show her how to apply it for the first time. Then I tell her to be doing it three times a day for five days. After doing that I ask her to come back to do a washout out. If she has been doing it properly we go ahead and do that washout and dry mopping. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings VHTs. This is my reply to that question. When I look inside the ear and see no pus or wax but the lady experiences itching, there could be germs. May be she had a shower and water went in her ears  and now there are germs. Her condition needs specialists."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thank you Nora. You have answered very well but you have not shown us which ear is normal or abnormal. Another thing you have not ticked the bit where it shows wax. You have also not ticked if they have hearing loss. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Nora thank you for your answer however as Dorothy correctly observed this is called ""microtia"". The pinna is abnormally shaped following birth. You are right that you should refer them to a specialist who can surgically reconstruct the pinna. Thank you. Also if you want to learn more please refer to your booklet we gave at the training day. Microtia will be in the section on outer ear disorders."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Morning VHTs. Here is a new case study. Case: On a home visit you see a child, Joyce Nakosi, who is 3 years old. The mother says that for the past two days the child has been crying, feverish, irritable and has a respiratory tract infection. They have been coughing a lot and sleeping poorly. You take the history from the mother and said says that the child has been tugging at their right ear like they are in pain, but do not have any discharge coming from the right ear. The left ear is ok.

You look in the ear with your otoscope and the ear drum (tympanic membrane) looks like this: "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Good morning VHTs. Here is todays question. How can you recommend community members to prevent malaria? Do you have any questions about malaria or this case which you are uncertain of and would like us to answer?
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing for the country. For those who had patients and they got well, we thank God. And for those who are still sick, may God see you through. Now when I look at that photo, the condition is called fungal otitis externa and it's in our books if you read. Regards to you all and I wish you a blessed and peaceful day tomorrow. May God enable us to wake up alive. Good bye."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Thanks you very much. We lost charge as our phones ran out of battery. In Mulago people don't want to see you. You can go there when you are sick but you don't know where to start from . No one in there to guide you. You have to give money at each step of the way. That is why people don't go. Part B. We could have doctors, but they think in our country money has lost value, the money is so little that someone assumes that after going to school they will gain money. But they don't so they go abroad. That is why we don't have enough doctors. Part C. Those doctors should be brought to those small HCs like Mukono because it is near by. Leaving aside the issue of not seeing the doctors, someone from Makata has stsayed their whole life here and can't navigate Kampala. This makes them anxious. So I suggest the doctors come closer to the people. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Ok Thanks for all our answers - the hole is behind the pinna. It is called PRE-AURICULAR FISTULA. This is NOT  a cholesteatoma like some have suggested. Francesca it is also not the ear drum - you can only see the ear drum by looking inside the ear using the otoscope - this is the outside of the ear. Harriet, you are right in saying you need to refer to specialists, and that this can cause damage to the bone, however it will not cause cancer. It is more likely to cause a brain infection."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. Malnutrition is when a child feeds on food that is not important to the body. Important food to the body includes body building food, energy giving and one that fights against diseases. In my community we call it ""omusana"" which I think the whites call kwashiokor but correct me if not. Some call it ""obwosi"".  It is common amongst children who are not well fed and if their mothers were not having food rich in carbohydrates and that responsible for fighting against diseases while pregnant. Others didn't swallow iron tablets that enable the child to grow healthy. That's what causes malnutrition."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thanks Dorothy.. Malnutrition yes can be caused by eating an unvaried diet but it is mainly due to not enough food.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Thank you my fellow participants. People don't go to the government health centers because of the pain the have to endure. You have to wake up early to get there as soon as possible only for them to arrive at later hours. You then wait for long hours, and as you are finally about the get them, they break off for lunch. They then take long hours having lunch. If you have some little money you would rather go to a private clinic where you are more likely to receive immeadiate attention. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Good morning VHTs.I wish you a nice Sunday. My advice for todays question - be very hygenic in the home whether in the kitchen, the house, or the things she uses to prepare food. Another thing I advise her is to spray the cockroaches and flies and to not let them to get on the food. Also I advise her to cover the toilet. Another thing I advise her is not to keep animals around the house because Catherine told us that isn't good. Make sure you cook meat well. Also I teach her to tell the kids to wash their hands after they eat and the mum with soap even when preparing the food for the kids. Also giving them boiled water. Also boiling the water at home used to cook food - because using water which isn't boiled also causes diahorrea. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Thanks Patricia - it is actually called 'Microtia'. It can be fixed with surgery so it is important to tell the child that. It is not something caused by God, but it is a congenital abnormality."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	"Hi Everyone, welcome to the group. The purpose of this group is the share bi-monthly learning cases basd on the information you have collected on home visits. Catherine will be incharge of releasing the cases. Please respond to each case question each day and ask your fellow VHTs if you have any problems with any of the questions or if you don't understand something. Thank you for your efforts!"
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thank you Luke. We have not reached the lower part. You didn't put the sex of the patient. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	 Hi All VHTs. Thanks for your answers. I think we need to just do some refresher training on acute otitis media. Perhaps Bryan and Catherine can deliver this when I am away as most of the answers today were not correct unfortunatly.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	" Greetings to you all fellow health workers. This is my answer to today's question. After the mother explaining that to me, I can tell if the child is malnourished by pressing their leg and if it leaves a hole it means they are malnourished. If I find out they are malnourished, I advise the mother on what to do. Thank you."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thanks all those who replied to todays question - the question was what treatment do you give Patricia. What you can do in that situation is give ORS - ORS is a solution of sugar and salt. And they also need zinc tablets. After that you have to refer Patricia to the health centre for more treatment. Thank you so much. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Greetings to my VHTs. Sorry I did not answer yesterday I was at a burial so I didn't have time. If I examine the patient and I see they have cholesteatoma I refer the patient as soon as possible. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Welcome back from the meeting. Thanks for the work. It's me Patricia and this is my reply to today's question. That patient has a hearing loss so I would advise him to go and see ENT specialists for further examination. They would also advise him to get hearing aids to amplify sounds.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Good morning fellow health workers and thank God for this day.This is my answer to today's question. We must encourage people to sleep under treated mosquito nets. We should ask them to buy them if they can't get them from the health centre. They need to drain stagnant water around them too. Stagnant water is a breeding place for mosquitoes. They should also close their windows early and put screen nets on them. That's what I have to say about today's question.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers. Catherine, Bryan and Mr. Andrew greetings too. I have seen today's question. What causes malaria...there are many types of malaria including typhoid and the one caused by mosquito bites. Drinking unboiled water and not sleeping under a mosquito net make someone suffer from malaria. There are several types of malaria best known by health workers above us. That's my reply to today's question. Have a good day."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings VHTs. We usually give our opinions. What I think of Karl's answer that diarrhoea is caused by eating dirty stuff differs a little from his. Someone who eats dirty things gets typhoid but diarrhoea is caused by other things. One who eats dirty things passes out stool with blood but diarrhoea is caused by a lot of other things like too much heat in the stomach, eating a lot of food stuff and many others. That's what I think. Thank you."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	" Greetings fellow health workers. Now this is my answer to today's question. I would first of all advise Enoch's mother  to take that child for immunisation like my fellows have mentioned. The symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, swollen cheeks, pot belly and sometimes swollen arms. Such children tend to be sickly and take long to heal even with treatment. Another symptom is low body weight for their age. Also, they are always sad and do not play with others and they look tired all the time. If you lay them down on their bellies, the skin from their thighs to the buttocks becomes wrinkled. That's how I can tell if Enoch is malnourished."
-161	139	2	84	1	66	0	11	Facilitator	Wow great insights everyone. Thank you for answering the questions and for your work in the case this week. I'll be back in makata on Sunday . will see you all on Monday
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"All of you fellow VHTs, Andrew, Bryan, Catherine in your respective areas, I have just received this question. My phone was showing the word no service in place of the company name MTN. After switching it off is when I received the question but all along I thought it was a general problem from the company. I have seen the question very late. Forgive me. In the picture it's like there's a child but an older one who was born with something like a hole on the pinna. I usually see them on people but they hardly have any problems with them like pain. If I find someone like that having a problem with it, I don't give them any other advice but refer them to any ENT specialist for further advice or even treatment. But from what I know they hardly cause any pain unless the one bearing it experiences some changes otherwise they never have any problems. It's congenital so I advise the person to go and see ENT specialists. That's how I can handle it. I remain VHT Gordon at Makata. Thank you so much though I've replied late. I am sorry."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Hi vhts. I am writing a diahorrea case today as per Harriet's request.  I am so sorry for delaying the case. I've just had a really busy few days. But I will send it to Catherine today and I'll be back in makata on Monday
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings to you. It's me Isabella Kizza. Forgive me my airtel network ain't good and as I speak now I just climbed a tree. What I would tell the people in my community about preventing malaria doesn't differ so much from what my fellows have said. They include sleeping under a treated mosquito net, slashing tall grass and clearing bushes around their homes, covering holes that retain water now that we are in a rainy season and removing broken stuff like basins and bottles. They should also close windows and doors as early as possible before mosquitoes enter. They need to put screen nets in their windows too. That's what I can tell the people in my community. To answer Edward's question of whether eating so much maize can cause malaria, I think it doesn't. When someone eats the body reacts and their temperature rises which blacks mistake for malaria but it's just high temperature and not malaria. Thank you so much."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings VHTs; there is a question which had remained that Catherine had asked us - the one saying who is supposed to buy the medicine. First of all I greet you all. Those who wee there yesterday in the training, thank you so much Catherine, and also our coordinator Andrew and Mr. Bryan and also other doctors who gave us the last training. Both of them. They all did a great job for the country because it was all about health but I thank the VHTs who came from far. If I am to respond to the other question the patient has to try as much as possible to buy the medicine, because in the government hospitals - sometimes there is no medicine other than panadol which can't heal her problem. Let us see if we don't have another question - let me keep scrolling. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"I greet you all fellow VHTs. It's me Nora and this is my answer for today's question. First of all, I clean the boy's ear using antiseptics, then I dry it, after I give him antibiotic drops to kill bacterial germs. That's how I've answered today's question. Have a good day."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	Good morning VHTs. How would you manage this patient? What advice would you give them? If wax doesn’t come out after using olive oil and washout what should you do?
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and thanks for the work you're doing. How are you our bosses? Thank God for enabling you to serve us. I also thank our interpreters and may God bless them. How are you our supervisors Edward and Dorothy? Thank God who has protected you. Fellow VHTs, I love you in Christ. Now this is my answer to today's question. If the mother of that child asks me what to do, I advise her to buy her pain killers because of the pain and as a form of first aid. Truth is I am not the one supposed to treat that kind of disease so I refer them to ENT specialists for treatment. There is no pus to wash out or a hole so I cannot handle them. That's my answer to today's question."
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Well done Miss Catherine. We have understood the questions but most of the VHTs are now in the garden planting because it rained. We have understood the questions and we shall reply. Thanks so much.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"The treatment I can give to Patricia who I find out is dehydrated after checking  is mixing for her ORS. After giving her the ORS, I study her situation and if the diarrhoea stops, I don't refer her. If it doesn't stop, I refer her to the nearest health centre for treatment. Thanks so much."
-161	139	2	84	1	66	0	11	Facilitator	Thanks very much those who have given me all your different ideas about todays cases. You have given good ideas indeed. To those who have not managed to give your ideas today we try next time to see that you reply. You are not going to get any more cases up to the 11th of March. Therefore I REQUEST that if there is something you wish to talk about you use the other WhatsApp group. Thank you very much and have a good night. 
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Peer supervisor	"I also greet you VHTs; so for todays question what I do for Mrs. Annette I don’t give antibiotics even if they want them so much. I don’t give them and explain why I am not giving them antibiotics. I explain to her I examine the ears when they are normal so she does not need to use the antibiotics. I also don't see any kind of treatment that needs to be given to her as she only has itching in the ear. Itching in the ear does not have medicine. But what I can tell her, is that it could be because of too much heat, wax and bacteria like fungus. So I tell her to go to the hospital for more examination. That is where she can get treatment from. "
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	Greetings fellow VHTs. The first reason as to why patients don't go to Mulago is because the doctors there lack morale. The government cares less about patients. A patient spends the whole day and night in line and still doesn't get seen.It has ever happened to me too. That's the first reason that stops them. Those with money always access them.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	Facilitator	The next case will be released in 2 weeks time. Until then we can go back to the seeta nazigo/makata and kirujja butoke and kavuule groups unless people have important learning points to share in this group.
139	139	1	84	2	66	0	11	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs, Andrew, Bryan and Catherine. Thanks for the work you're doing for us. When I see that picture I see a hole. That hole in most cases is congenital but sometimes it's an infection with discharge coming out of it. If it's just like that with nothing coming out, I encourage the person and tell them there's no problem. But if it has any damage I refer the person to a specialist for further examination. That's my reply to the question."
-156	156	2	83	3	62	1	11	CHW	"Hello Dr. Andrew  I have a patient who has a swelling on the ear, but today we are meeting at 2pm so please can we see them together?"
-161	161	2	84	3	66	1	11	CHW	Hi Andrew. Good morning. I have a patient we were going to see today. He has a hearing loss and a swelling of the pinna and it has a perforation like a sinus on it. So I told them we will meet in town. Another patient does not hear. 
7	161	1	84	3	66	2	11	Facilitator	Hi Harriet. Sorry for the delay in replying. Did you find someone to help you film your video? Did you find out if they were malnourished ?  If you need to advise the mother then tell her to go to the health centre for an assessment by wicliffe
7	161	1	84	3	66	2	11	CHW	"It could be true because she has wounds. Also, this lady called X who had pus from the ears kept complaining of pain but I asked her and she said she no longer feels it. She also said she can at least hear a few words when someone speaks. We shall go back and check on her. Another thing, there's also X. When you look at Monday's program, I would like Andrew to see him as well. Thanks and good night."
7	161	1	84	3	66	2	11	CHW	Greetings to you all VHTs. I found a patient called X. The problem she has is that the ear is swollen like you see in the picture and it is painful. She is in so much pain. I would like feedback from Andrew.
