-104,-92,0,98,1,6,0,0,Facilitator, Other VHTs what do you think causes itching in the ear?
-100,-90,0,93,1,5,0,2,Facilitator,Please reply to the question for today. 
-106,-84,1,11,0,85,0,10,Facilitator,Thank you very much Isabella. 
-88,-82,0,83,1,3,0,2,Facilitator,If we have evidence and are informed citizens aware of our rights and the needs of those who we serve then we are empowered.
-106,-80,0,95,0,-2,1,13,Peer supervisor,What is the solution to the pinna?
-109,-79,0,90,0,4,1,15,CHW,"Francesca, this is group for case studies. Stop asking Luke what he is saying. "
-116,-74,0,86,0,9,1,21,Facilitator,We need to go see him urgently. As in tonight....
-156,-54,1,51,0,85,0,20,CHW,Good. But remember coartem dose is based on the weight of the child. So the number of tablets will depend on their weight.
-132,-48,0,90,2,9,1,33,Peer supervisor,The medicine that is remaining is just for a day. What can I do for her? She is getting the treatment from Riubaga 
-108,-36,1,36,0,72,0,0,Peer supervisor, It's ok Dr
-25,-25,1,63,0,37,0,51,CHW,The only advice I give to her maamu to  take him in  big hospital .
-15,-15,0,50,0,40,1,75,Peer supervisor, Jovia needs help. She got a client with pus and wounds . Kindly let her be helped. Thanks
-185,-13,1,86,0,93,0,6,CHW,"C. As VHTs, it's our responsibility to explain to and sensitise people on how to take good care of their ears. It's important not to give up until we are sure they know and understand what to do. We should also sensitize them on some of the myths in communities like buzzing sounds that are mistaken for someone being talked about, itching that implies one has syphillis and others. Since our doctor has discovered many issues of hearing loss, he probably has something he can do about it. Hearing aids are expensive but he can find a way to help. When he goes back, he can find ways or else in Uganda we are likely to have many deaf people. May be government health centres should also sensitize people on the diseases they treat including ears."
-193,-11,1,91,0,95,0,7,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs. My name is Nora and this is my reply to the questions. 4a) The most important issue is lack of transport to facilitate one to and fro, and yet seeing the doctor requires money one may not have at the moment. I think hospitals that treat ears should have various branches for example in Mukono and other areas."
-188,-10,0,98,1,89,0,1,Facilitator,Wow - well done Dorothy. That was a great video. You can see clearly the tape was 'green' meaning she is not malnourished. Well done and well done for selecting the correct tape. Brilliant!
-101,-1,0,52,1,50,0,-1,Facilitator, Excellent answer Dorothy.
0,0,1,54,0,53,0,1,CHW,"What I would like to add on is malaria caused by eating half cooked meat and unboiled milk commonly known as brucella. It is also very dangerous and once one gets it, it may not go well with them."
-147,3,0,72,2,18,1,57,Peer supervisor,"Morning members, I need your help on this issue, I have a client here, he says he has pain in the left ear, but when we looked in the ear, the ear drum is normal, but when you look in the right ear which doesn't pain him, there is too much wax, what can I do for this patient, I new your advice now and at least I do something before the patient goes."
-42,6,0,82,2,64,1,24,Facilitator,Yes thank you so much to all vhts for these suggestions. Its hard. Ideally she needs to be in a health centre for a few weeks to get special treatment. But I don't think the mum can afford it and she has mental health issues meaning I don't think she can be responsible for the child. I agree with Karl. We should first involve the father and His parents. Some vhts should go in a group to inform them and try come up with a solution which the family think they can manage. If that fails a good samartian might have to accompany the child for a few days.
8,8,0,61,1,72,0,3,Facilitator,"Nora, Qiana, Isabella, Gordon, Patricia, Jane, Francesca, Harriet ne Dorothy thanks for taking the time to reply. "
13,13,0,55,1,81,0,13,CHW, Super well done Patricia. Yes that is correct.
15,15,0,79,1,93,0,-1,CHW,Good morning fellow VHTs. Those of you who are not answering the questions. Qiana comeon. 
18,18,1,84,0,44,0,22,CHW,"I still feel pain, am trying to step down slowly I don't know whether tomorrow I will get treatment because am going back to see a specialist"
22,22,0,86,1,104,0,-4,CHW,"Good morning my fellow VHTs, thanks for the work we are doing for the country. Welcome back from the church for those who went for prayers. The ones who I sending you greetings is Qiana and welcome back. "
27,27,0,16,1,78,0,35,Facilitator,This is excellent Edward. You are acting as an advocate for your community and as a leader informing people of their rights as citizens. Thank you for your hard work.
28,28,0,66,1,94,0,0,CHW,"I thank my fellow VHTs like Dorothy, Luke, Bwendi, Janet, Karl, Isabella and the rest we work with. Patricia, thanks so much. Thanks for replying to questions. It motivates our teachers. It shows we were giving it our all during the training. They also get to know the people they placed in communities to help the people are doing well. That's it. God bless you and keep it up. Amen."
28,28,0,53,1,84,0,3,Facilitator,"Thank you very much Harriet, Luke, Nora amd Patricia. The rest of you please give me your replies. "
35,35,0,65,1,98,0,-2,Facilitator,"Thanks all of you, because all your answers are good. Do the same tomorrow. Good night. "
-182,36,2,51,1,58,0,73,Peer supervisor," Sorry Matthew about the pain in your leg, and reminding Francesca about Tendo, but am requesting you that if you have any problem about using the groups try to get some one who knows like Francesca, Byamukama and other people in the other groups, we work together and see how we can solve that problem."
38,38,1,76,0,36,0,2,CHW,What you have said is okay but where shall we get the MUAC tape from? You're the ones with them but we know how to use them because we watched the video. I don't if others know but I personally do from the video I watched.
39,39,0,46,1,86,0,1,CHW,"Good morning fellow VHTs thank you for your answers. Regards to Madam Catherine thank you for helping us, same regards to Dr. Bryan. "
41,41,1,90,0,36,0,13,Facilitator,Jane we want to know what causes itching in the ear before we know what to do with the patient. 
38,42,1,70,0,30,2,2,Facilitator,Mr. Matthew the messages you have sent in this group are meant for the other one. This is meant for the case studies. 
44,44,1,72,0,11,0,17,CHW," 4a) The reason as to why people don't go to health centres is not because of long queues but it's because of the few health workers. You see even us when we go out in the community to treat ears, you can work on three people and feel fatigued already. Those health workers get tired, and that's why they're unable to work on some patients. Others ask for bribe. Another issue is, when ears just have discharge some people don't feel pain. In Uganda when someone doesn't feel pain it's hard for them to go to the doctor. That's my point. Also, our government doesn't mind much about health issues. It only cares about security issues. Actually the security budget is higher than that of health. If only the health budget was bigger, we would be so lucky."
45,45,0,44,1,90,0,1,CHW,"I am sorry for replying in the other group. I had forgotten but I am really sorry and thanks Bryan for reminding me. By the time I remembered, I had already sent it. Thank you so much."
46,46,1,96,0,51,0,-1,CHW,"This is my reply to todays question - when I go back after 2 weeks and she didn't buy the medicine I tell her she didn't do a good thing because she is sick and she needs to improve her health. The more you delay the more money it costs. When you treat it earlier, you spend less money and you get cured very fast. "
47,47,1,91,0,43,0,1,CHW,"Fellow VHTs, this is my reply to today's questions. 4a) What prevents patients from going to Mulago is because the president said it's no longer free of charge. They will continue using it to treat only very complicated diseases and someone has to pay some money. The amount I heard him mention was too high to be affordable by common man. Another issue is some people don't know where it's located and the queue is always long. Doctors always want some money which we may refer to as bribe. 4b)In 2009, we had few doctors because all doctors who have gone to school end up going abroad (brain drain). It is an important issue that is caused by low salary. 4c) Those doctors should be coming to health centres grade II, III and IV. They should give out their phone numbers. That's my reply to the questions. I remain Byamukama Gordon."
50,50,0,27,1,81,0,4,Facilitator,Thank you very VHTs for those who have replied on todays case. 
51,51,1,78,0,13,0,14,Peer supervisor,"That patient has pre-auricular sinus and it's responsible for her ear being in that kind of condition. What I can do is give her pain killers to reduce pain. After that, I refer her to specialists for further examination."
54,54,0,27,1,86,0,5,Facilitator,Super answers Francesca. Well done!!
55,55,0,36,1,91,0,0,Facilitator,Very interesting points. Thank you for sharing Edward.
56,56,0,35,1,98,0,7,CHW,Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for last week's work. Those with patients and who have lost loved ones may God be with you. I welcome back you all from the meeting at Seeta Nazigo. We thank God for bringing you to attend and I'm sure He has enabled you to reach safely.
58,58,1,87,0,31,0,-2,CHW,"The question I would like to ask is why do most people who get checked using RDT are not found to be having malaria yet they feel all its symptoms. And when they check using a microscope, they discover it. I would like an explanation on that. Another question is why is it that when someone begins to take malaria tablets their condition worsens. If they weren't convulsing especially amongst children, they begin to. What causes it?"
-13,61,0,73,1,97,2,37,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs and this is my suggestion about the child. It's true the child's father is around but is no better than the mum. The other relative is the paternal grandfather but he is 100+ years. I think much as the parents are not mentally okay, they have done something because the child looks better than she was when they had just brought her. I suggest if the child is given treatment, us VHTs don't stay very far from them and can check on them once in awhile. The mother told me the problem is she doesn't take milk and only takes porridge after being forced. The other food she tries to eat is rice and posho. Also, she can hardly afford it but if she gets it, she's able to feed her. She's also capable of looking after her child since she's not that badly off mentally. I suggest if the child gets treatment, we can check on her every now and then to show her how to give it to her. That's my opinion."
62,62,1,85,0,3,0,20,Facilitator, If we can't see this person now Dorothy we should see them first thing in the morning
62,62,1,96,0,32,0,2,Facilitator,"Acute Otitis Media (AOM) WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH CHRONIC SUPPRATIVE OTITIS MEDIA WHICH IS WHERE PUS IS PRESENT is just where there is a red, painful ear drum, but no perforation, no pus. It is not dangerous and usually settles with simple pain relief. It is most common in young children under 5, but can happen to anyone at any age. It is usually caused by a simple virus, and therefore does not need antibiotics. Remember antibiotics are only effective against BACTERIA, NOT VIRUSES. Finally the child might also have a cough or cold cause by the same virus."
62,62,1,82,0,8,0,12,Peer supervisor, What I do for that mother is to give her antibiotic drops to be put in the boy's ears i.e three drops three times a day for seven days. Afte 7 days I follow up. 
63,63,1,80,0,0,0,17,Peer supervisor,"I have seen that patient, after seeing them and doing all that I send them to a specialist for futher examination. The specialist can see what to do for that one. "
64,64,1,84,0,19,0,1,CHW,"This is my answer to the first question as Harriet. Some people are reluctant to go to the health centres because they're asked for money which is true. Much as they do ask for it, the government facilities have no medicine. You can only find it there once in awhile. Another reason is they take long to attend to the patients. Some patients can be very ill and decide to sleep around the health centre but when the nurses arrive they insult them instead. Some nurses are very rude but very good ones are there too."
65,65,1,91,0,23,0,3,CHW,"If I examine the ears of the 50 year old woman and find no wax but she says they itch, I advise her not to use sticks in them. Another thing is she may be having infections in her blood."
65,65,1,70,0,3,0,2,Facilitator,Ok Luke
66,66,1,95,0,31,0,-2,CHW,"As for today's question concerning yesterday's gentleman, these are the causes of hearing loss I can give. First of all, diseases can affect ears causing hearing loss. Secondly, loud noises like bullet sounds can cause the problem too. Some people are born with abnormalities on the bones of hearing. Disabilities for example some teachers at schools slap students in the ears. In addition to that, violence in homes causing one partner to beat the other which may damage their ears and cause hearing loss. Using strong medicine like quinine. Lastly, old age though that gentleman is 37 which is not so old. That's my reply to today's question. I remain Gordon, VHT Makata."
67,67,0,16,1,90,0,7,CHW,Thanks Dorothy and well done. One litre equals to two cups of water though not four. That's what I think.
-51,67,2,59,0,89,1,97,CHW,"Greetings Bryan, for the work you're doing. I have a client with a perf and pus, they need the medicine. Please send me the medicine for this. I will take a photo of the child. "
68,68,0,24,1,92,0,0,Facilitator,Thanks for the information
68,68,0,9,1,81,0,4,Facilitator,Dorothy thank you for your reply. 
-36,68,2,52,0,80,1,96,CHW,"Isabella, that issue you have pointed out about our patients is good . As for X, if only you had seen Doctor last time. Now X and her husband got lucky. They got for them a specialist who will be working on them. If you had brought that child for his ears to be examined, we would have gotten somewhere and doctor would have helped us. They would go at once with the rest because he will be the one driving them. Don't you see in his message?"
69,69,1,93,0,10,0,14,CHW,If the boy hasn't gotten better I refer him immeadiatly to the bigger health center. 
70,70,1,89,0,19,0,0,CHW,"Sorry I had forgotte to give the name of the disease, but it is called otitis media. "
71,71,1,85,0,15,0,-1,CHW," Second reason that stops them is government doctors who have so much interest in money and a lot of money. If they don't know who you're or have no attachment to anyone, you cannot access them. The rich get seen first even when you get in line before them. That also discourages people. If there's any way these doctors can change their attitude, we shall be glad."
72,72,1,92,0,21,0,-1,CHW," 4c) What we can do to ensure such people are taken care of and followed up is  fulfilling the needs of the doctors health wise, personal needs and may be spiritually. Also, training VHTs to acquire more skills than what they already have for example we are now more skilled than our fellow VHTs who were left out. Extending health services nearer to communities for easy accessibility and for VHTs to follow them up easily. That's my opinion."
73,73,0,21,1,95,0,1,CHW,Thank you very much. 
73,73,1,89,0,0,0,16,CHW,"In the same house. I found another child who has a problem with both ears. A parent told me whenever the child has a cold, the ears also get affected. So the parent told me they got a doctor for a child. So this doctor traced the child. They asked about the condition of the child. I left the doctor to treat the child. "
73,73,1,92,0,18,0,1,CHW,I advise her not to miss a day of putting the olive oil in. Sometimes you give them the olive oil and they decide not to follow the instructiions - they apply it just once a day. But I emphasise the instruction. 
74,74,1,97,0,23,0,0,CHW,"Its me Harriet. I can see the childs ear has pus. And the disease the child has is called otitis media. That is what I see, but I have just seen this so that is why I am replying now. "
75,75,1,86,0,10,0,1,Peer supervisor,"You asked us should people buy medicine for themselves. My view is yes. People should buy it for themselves because the medicine might be so expensive so if we buy for them we might fail. Yet it is so bad to start something and we do not finish it so I think they should buy the medicine for themselves. Why? Me I want them to buy it for themselves cos people will be more careful. We are careless me inclusive. For example you give them free olive oil to put in the ears, but you go there and try to wash out the ear so when they buy it they will take the responsibility to make sure their money is not wasted. When we give it for free they can drop it on the road side even when they have not finished their doses. They throw the medicine - if we give for free they won't take it seriously. So I want them to buy it for themselves. That way they will be more responsible. Another thing when the person buys his or her own medicine it is properly prescribed and the money. So the person can also tell a friend that I bought the medicine for myself, it is not from the government or free of charge. "
75,75,1,86,0,6,0,5,CHW, That disease is on the outer part of the ear because that's where you've pointed. The bones behind the ear are swollen too.
76,76,1,86,0,5,0,5,CHW,It is caused by how we take care of our bodies. Poor hygiene is responsible for such conditions therefore it can lead to an infection like otitis externa.
76,76,1,91,0,5,0,10,CHW,"Catherine, I call the disease otitis externa because it's on the outer part where he has pointed"
78,78,1,93,0,17,0,-2,CHW,"If Joyce's mother asks me the causes of acute otitis media, I tell her that since the child is young her body cannot fight against diseases. I also tell her that severe malaria causes it too. I then advise her to feed that child on a balanced diet and to treat them if they suffer from malaria because those are the two biggest causes of that disease. That's my answer to today's question."
80,80,1,91,0,6,0,5,CHW,"My reply to the first question is - first take the history of the patient, then you examine the ears and test the hearing. Then question B. You write the history on the form that was given to us, then question C. Name of the patient, sex, age, and how long they have been having the problem. "
80,80,1,89,0,3,0,6,CHW,"After washing the ears of the patient and finding out the wax is still there I do the wash out again, if I found out it is still there after washing out again I refer the patient to the specialist. "
81,81,1,91,0,9,0,1,CHW,I  am Isabella Kizza. People don't want to go to government health centres because their health workers don't care about patients. I think you all remember during the training the lady who almost died from there just because she was lacking water. That's the reason people would rather pay money in a private clinic where they care.
82,82,1,94,0,2,0,10,Peer supervisor,"Some of the other questions I can ask the mother are how long has the child had the problem, and the medicine they have been using to treat the child. "
83,83,1,89,0,4,0,2,Peer supervisor,The tablets I know they give to children with diarrhoea are called zinc.
84,84,1,88,0,3,0,1,CHW," My question is they always tell us one may suffer from malaria and it damages their brain, what type of malaria causes that?"
85,85,1,89,0,3,0,1,CHW,"As a VHT, what I can do is to sensitize them on what to do and ask them to avoid things that may affect their ears."
-103,85,1,13,2,81,0,9,Facilitator,"Thank you Karl, You were supposed to stop on the date. "
86,86,1,92,0,0,0,6,CHW,The illness is called 'otitis externa'. 
87,87,0,0,1,93,0,6,CHW,How are you Andrew? Thanks for the work. Thanks for training us.
-223,87,1,71,2,84,0,68,CHW,Isabella are you back so that we can go wash the other old ladys ears as we agreed? Because the appointment time is about to reach so please hurry if we are going to reach this woman on time. Thanks so much. 
-186,88,2,85,0,49,1,52,Facilitator,Ok the little spot I am not concerned about. I just thought the back of the tragus looked very swollen like mastoiditis. It sounds less concerning if he is generally ok. But let's go see him tomororrow. 
88,88,1,90,0,2,0,0,CHW,"Question 2. When I find those people in my community, I encourage them and tell them they ain't alone with hearing problems. I also advise them that there are organizations that empower deaf people with technical skills in carpentry and tailoring using sign language. We have encountered such people in society and they are usually very good. That's the advise I can give. There are also schools that teach deaf people using sign language."
-212,88,0,62,2,91,1,59,CHW," I also greet you my fellow VHTs, thank you for the work you are doing, greetings Mrs Isabella, about that issue, as me Nora this is how I respond to you, I also had the same issue where Mrs Anna who got the same problem yet we had washed her out and gave antibiotics, but when she came back to me, I did what I was told in the meeting, I washed her again and gave her antibiotics, now she's feeling okay and she no longer her pus in the ear, I was suggesting may be you do the same to your patient, you do a washout and give her antibiotics, the pus will stop, I encourage other VHTs to give their ideas, thank you."
89,89,1,98,0,3,0,6,CHW,I Luke. The first thing I do incase there is no change is to refer the child to specialists because there is nothing else I can do. So I send the child to Mulago. 
89,89,1,91,0,0,0,2,CHW,I personally say we should improve sanitation in our communities and continue sensitizing people to sleep under treated mosquito nets.
89,89,1,93,0,1,0,3,Peer supervisor,What I see in the picture is someone's head with an abnormal shape of the pinna.I know it as microtia. How I can handle the condition is by letting the person know it's possible to be operated if they're fine with it. And then I refer them to a specialist for further examination.
89,89,1,94,0,0,0,5,CHW,"The advice I give her is to not insert anything in the ears, like they insert things in their ears then the wax sticks. "
91,91,1,99,0,8,0,0,CHW,"Question no.1) if I find that lady with pain and discharge, first thing I do is to give her some pain killers to reduce the pain. After that, I wash her ear. When I'm done washing her ear, I dry it. Next I put in antibiotic drops to heal the wounds. Three drops. I then let her go home. That's my answer to the first question. Question 2) I take her history but before that, I give her the consent form to confirm that she has accepted the treatment I will be giving her. I explain to her why she has to sign it. After accepting, I give her pain killers. When she says the pain has reduced, I do the ear wash out to remove the discharge. Next I dry it like I said in the first place. Another question, what important questions I'm I supposed to ask her. They include, how long she has had the pain, if she has had any treatment before and then I examine. After examining, I ask if she has any allergy. If she says she has, I call my bosses to inquire from them what to do like they told us."
92,92,0,-2,1,96,0,6,Facilitator,Thank you very much Mr. Matthew
92,92,1,94,0,0,0,2,CHW,Now for the last question. If I see that the wax is still there after doing all that I make a referral to a specialist. 
92,92,1,98,0,3,0,3,Facilitator,Q2b. You then look inside her ear and you see this. What do you see and what you think this might be?
-115,93,1,17,2,87,0,11,Peer supervisor,It's a good idea. We shall try to do that in our community of service and wait for those who can come to us by themselves from far places. Thanks.
93,93,1,97,0,2,0,2,CHW,"This problem is there in Uganda (4B), because someone can care about his child and pay for school fees, the child goes to school. After studies the child can't find jobs and those people who are doing those jobs are so old. The parent sees they have lost money on the child. They think of another option - so they tell the child to go abroad to look for jobs. Those people abroad have more opportunities that here in Uganda. That is why they go abroad. So here we don't have experts. Another problem and cause, though our doctors work hard - they get little pay. They know the money is not enough. Even getting that money some of them don;t get it on time. They worked for their money, but the administrators take months and months. They stay in self contained rooms which are costly, the need to buy food, pay bills. All this is hard if you don't get paid promptly. These are big sacrifices for them to make. If the conditions are so hard why can't such a doctor just go abroad where they are paid well. "
94,94,1,97,0,5,0,-2,CHW,"I will start with the second question, the reason as to why people who are poor normally get chronic supprativr otitis media is that in most cases poor people have no money to take them to the Health centre to get assessment and also treatment, that's why they end up using sticks when they've got a lot of wax in their ears, some stay in pain not knowing even where to go to get help, now like a disease for sickle cells in some places they offer free treatment but because of lack of transport to take them where there is free treatment, they get affected. Therefore they lose hope, even in Seeta Nazigo Health Centre, they may be offering free dental services but a poor person even fails to get 5000 shillings to bring him or her for treatment which is not the case which the rich."
98,94,1,98,2,-2,0,2,Facilitator,"What is the ""hole"" called Luke? There is a technical term to describe it which you should now be aware of . If you are not I advise you to refer to your booklet from the training day in January."
95,95,1,99,0,6,0,-2,CHW," I write the history in the other big book that was given to us. I write down my names, head of household who signed the consent form and the names of the patient, their village plus everything concerning their ears. For example they told me they feel some pain, so I ask how long they've had it. After that, I ask them if they have any other disease besides ears. When I'm done with that, I embark on examination for the second time since I would have finished the wash out and given them some pain killers. I then check their hearing using the whispered voice hearing test. After that I give them a copy of the form to confirm that I have successfully treated them and then I take the pink one to the health centre. As for the white one, I write in it like Dorothy told us i.e the phone number of the patient and where they stay to help me remember."
96,96,1,95,0,-1,0,0,CHW,"Question B. People are discouraged when there's no treatment for hearing loss. Hearing aids are so expensive yet the disease is so rampant amongst the poor. People are unable to purchase them which is a big problem. I heard that they cost between shs. 700,000 and shs. 3,000,000. Some of our patients here in Makata were once told the same thing."
96,96,1,98,0,2,0,0,CHW,I have not been around and had no battery
97,97,1,101,0,5,0,-1,CHW," This is my reply to today's question. I refer that patient to a specialist, because his condition is hearing loss therefore he needs a hearing aid."
97,97,1,97,0,1,0,-1,CHW,And after doing the dry mopping I check again using my otoscope. If I check and it is not clean yet I mix iodine and water again (1ml of iodine and 9ml of water). Then I wash out. I do it the second time then I check again. 
97,97,1,100,0,4,0,-1,CHW,"B. People are frustrated because of poverty. It all goes back to poverty. People are asked to buy the hearing aids but they give up because they don't have money. If only the government puts more emphasis on health issues for example by constructing more facilities where people can buy hearing aids, they may cost way cheaper than they do now. It hasn't put any effort in health but has instead done so in security."
98,98,1,102,0,7,0,-3,Facilitator,"If you look closely Luke, the ear drum is red and swollen."
98,98,1,94,0,-4,0,0,Facilitator,"Ok Karl, so it means the government is the one responsible, but it doesn't have that?"
100,100,1,98,0,-7,0,5,CHW,"After I'm done with that, I give him antibiotics. To put in his ear."
104,104,1,95,2,8,0,-1,CHW,"Well done health workers. Symptoms like not urinating, passing out stool all those times and sunken eyes are all very dangerous when a child has diarrhoea. We immediately mix ORS and ask the mother to give it to the child until they get to the health centre. I refer them to the health centre because I don't have treatment for the condition."
104,104,1,98,2,3,0,-3,CHW,Another question was saying do you think people should buy medicines for themselves; it is true. The first reason is that in Uganda now there is a problem with medicine - it doesn't care about health. So someone has to buy medicine for themselves. Another thing is that when you use your money to buy medicine you use it as directed. But in most cases people become careless because they got it for free. They did not put any money from their pockets in - but if they use their money they can do things right. So I think people should buy medicine according to the way Uganda is. Even in Mulago nothing is free. That is my suggestion have a good day. 
106,106,1,98,2,9,0,1,CHW,"c) I ask for the name of the head of household, their sex and age.  ask how long she has had the condition and whether she received any treatment. If she says no to the latter, I seek for her permission to wash her ears. If she accepts, I wash and dry them and then re examine to see if they're now clean. When I'm done with that, I put three antibiotic drops for three weeks as I do follow up. Regards to you my fellow VHTs and thanks for answering the questions."
-195,107,1,68,2,83,0,44,Facilitator,Thank you Isabella. You are filled very well but you were supposed to stop on the date. You have not put the sex. 
-116,108,2,108,0,4,1,4,CHW,"Edward, The person you are talking about who has a foreign body who comes from Makata, they have brought them. I want to know where they come from so that we can also understand the one you are asking Andrew about. I was to know is it a man or woman?"
110,110,1,99,2,8,0,-3,CHW,"This is my answer to the question fellow health workers. It doesn't differ so much from what my fellows said. We can prevent malaria by sleeping under treated mosquito nets, clearing bushes around us, cleaning our compounds and ensuring there are no holes to retain water, burning any tins like the ones of vaseline and bottles since they also retain water where mosquitoes can breed from. That's how I can advise the people in my community. My question is, people in our areas ask us that since we advise them to sleep under mosquito nets and the government gives them those nets free of charge, can't they also give them the medicine used to treat them? Some of them are low income earners so after washing them they cannot afford it. That's my question. Have a good Sunday and regards to you. I apologize for being the last one to answer the question. Mistakes are human but I am sorry. It's me Hadijja."
-130,110,1,50,2,70,0,10,Facilitator,Well done Dorothy this is absolutely correct. Do all other VHTs agree? If you do you don't need to reply to the question as this is the correct answer.
110,110,1,109,0,0,0,-1,Facilitator,At what time?
112,112,1,105,0,-5,0,-2,CHW,1a) I first introduce myself to the head of the household and seek their permission to check her or any person in that household.
-117,113,1,17,2,98,0,2,Facilitator,Thanks for contributing Matthew. Please see the answer I also gave to Gordon. Thank you
114,114,1,94,2,22,0,2,Facilitator,"Francesca one of the boxes. You have said both ears are abnormal, but you were meant to tick one box. You have not indiciated issues with the ear or ear canal to show how they are. You have indicated well about the hearing test and thanks. The last part of the paper can't be seen. "
115,115,1,107,0,-7,0,-1,Facilitator,This is todays question. 
115,115,1,93,2,22,0,0,CHW,Please forgive me. I didn't reply to the question because my battery was dead. I have the solar charger but there was no sunshine. By the time I checked it was too late for me to answer. 
-129,115,1,42,2,80,0,7,Facilitator,Thank you very much Dorothy. You are right but we only wanted the first part. 
-161,115,2,93,0,23,1,45,Facilitator, Francesca told me that the mother was waiting for me to take her to Mukono HC IV on last Friday at 2pm. I don't know may be she is still expecting a lift to the Health Centre. I was thinking of passing by her house today.
-171,117,1,59,2,85,0,27,Facilitator,"Karl you did well. The first part and thank you so much. You were supposed to tick that the person has a hearing loss. Another thing, you are supposed to tick the last box to show that you have left a copy with the patient and the health center and to write a plan of what you want to do. "
118,118,1,111,0,-7,0,0,CHW,I take their history and ask how long they've had the condition.
120,120,1,71,2,69,0,20,CHW,"Well done fellows. All you have talked about is right. We go there and find long lines and we don't even get the treatment. The doctors that have studied should be given opportunity to work in health centres. Some doctors are very old and have worked for years me. You go to seek treatment and they refuse to attend to you .Someone feels like they inherited the position and can only leave after death. You hear people have studied but have no jobs but we haven't been helped. I always see from our health centres here forexample seeta Nazigo, you find a very old woman tired of giving birth and cannot even advise the pregnant women or take good care of them. I think they should give chance to the fresh ones. That's my opinion."
122,122,1,79,2,67,0,24,CHW,Good morning fellow workers  the picture shows me the disease called  fungal otitis  external.
-128,126,1,49,2,78,0,1,CHW,"Thank you Luke, thanks for advising me. Let me reply. "
-201,127,1,66,2,98,0,37,Facilitator,Ok thanks Gordon. Not necessarily true. For ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA (AOM) you can usually wait for 2 days to see if the child improves. They need pain killers and if they feel better no need to refer to a hospital.
130,130,2,56,1,77,0,3,Facilitator,"You have replied to the question well Matthew, but you have not told us what advice you will give to the patient. "
131,131,1,78,2,52,0,-1,Facilitator, All very interesting views. I think then as VHTs you should be advocating for the poorer members of society to ensure they are treated fairly.
-240,134,1,81,2,106,0,53,CHW,"Greetings to you all our health workers, Mwebe, Andrew, Bryan, Catherine and thanks for what you're doing for us. I would like to thank all the VHTs and our supervisors for everything you're doing. I can see a picture of someone either a child or an adult plus an ear which I think is the left one. If the person was born with that hole which we call lukatu in Luganda, it poses no threat. But from what we have been told if it causes problems like swelling, the advice I can give to the person is to refer them to an ENT specialist for further examination. The biggest problem is what we copy like pricking ears with machines which makes the ear look like two in one. That's my view. Thanks so much. It's me Matthew Johnson, VHT Makata."
135,135,0,-1,1,95,2,39,Facilitator,"Thank you Dorothy, you have given a very good opinion and please continue to encourage people and sensistise them on how to prevent hearing loss. "
139,139,1,88,2,53,0,2,Facilitator,Well done Gordon this is correct. It is a mastoid abcess and needs urgent referral
143,143,1,91,2,48,0,-4,CHW,"I will begin with the last question then answer the rest afterwards. Greetings to you all. If ENT specialists say that hearing aids are expensive, what I would do as a VHT is to counsel them. I would also politely advise them to go to schools that teach sign language. From there they can a lot of things. I know those people can even be more intelligent than us who are able to hear and speak properly."
148,148,1,100,2,44,0,-4,CHW,"I greet you in the name of Jesus. My suggetions about this lady Annette; when I go there when she didn't buy the medicine, my job is to talk with her very well because she was supposed to buy the medicine to help her get out of the problem. So I tell her to look for all ways of buying that medicine. Then I show her the benefit of treating the illness, so I tell her if you delay the illness will get worse, treatment wil become expensive. So I beg you to try as much as possible and buy the medicine. That is my suggestion. "
150,150,1,96,2,52,0,-2,Facilitator,"Thanks for the answers VHTs. The answers are as follows: Diarrhoea is 3 or more loose or watery stools in 1 day or Diarrhoea is a sign there is a germ in the belly. You can get diahorrea for all of the following reasons -	Eating foods prepared with water that is not clean or safe. Eating spoiled foods or uncooked meats; Children not washing hands; Caregivers not washing hands; Living in unclean conditions or too close to animals; Flies landing on uncovered food
"
150,150,1,95,2,58,0,3,CHW,"Question C. Incase specialists come and I have people with hearing loss in my community, as a VHT I would come together with my fellows and ensure we counsel them. We can come up with a health camp like the one we had at seeta Nazigo health centre III and bring them together. Others may be having their relatives with jobs and money so they can be helped. That's my only suggestion. Counselling them because we don't have money to give them neither are we ENT specialists. Only thing we can do is advising them and counselling them whenever that camp is conducted. Those who can access help, well and good but those who are not able to can be helped that way. That's my reply to the third question. It's me VHT Johnson Matthew. Have a good day our health workers who are present and the rest of the VHTs."
152,152,1,86,2,70,0,4,Facilitator,Well done Dorothy and Edward. This is the correct way to fill in the forms. Very good detail
-206,152,0,27,2,90,1,89,CHW,"Well done Isabella, what you need to do for that patient according to what we were told in the meeting, you have to do it like Nora has explained to you, do another washout, because the ear might be having a wound so you need to do a washout of about three times, then you give antibiotics, then you give her some pain killers to reduce on the pain, that is my suggestion."
-43,153,3,91,2,55,1,7,Facilitator,Hi VHTs - slight dilemma. We need your opinions on how to handle this matter. Harriet identified a malnourished child in Makata who had a red MUAC tape. The child is 10 months old. The mother has learning difficulties and has no money. She is not able to bring the child to the health centre where they will need to be for a few weeks while the child has the appropriate feed and medicine and is monitored. We have provided them with a referral letter but we want you to advise us  on what you think should be done. Thank you.
155,155,1,93,2,80,0,18,CHW,"I am sorry someone called and my message was cut short. What I wanted to ask since I am not sure is what time we shall be meeting on Thursday. I am able to communicate now because someone helped me with the phone but it loses WhatsApp and blocks everything I try to do. Like I told you, Andrew and Bryan repaired it when we were at the health centre but it still bothers me that's why I am unable to reply to the questions. Thanks so much though for advising us. It's me your fellow health worker Johnson Matthew."
159,159,1,94,2,85,0,20,CHW,"Now for today's question of Annette asking for treatment for her itching ears, I personally refer her to the health centre to get pain killers. They can also examine her and if they have no medicine for her problem, they can write it down for her to get it from any pharmacy. If she insists on getting antibiotics I explain to her that I examined her ears and there's nothing like pus or perforations. Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication. I strengthen her and advise her to go to the health centre for medicine that can stop that itching. In case they don't have it, she can get it from the pharmacy after them writing it down. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much."
-161,161,1,67,2,94,0,0,Peer supervisor,"Good morning fellow workmates. If I find out that patient has cholesteatoma, I immediately refer her to an ENT specialist because they know more than I do and can offer better treatment. Thanks a lot."
162,162,1,102,2,56,0,-4,Facilitator,Morning VHTs. Next part of this case - the question is what is the cause of malaria?
163,163,1,86,2,77,0,0,CHW,"For the third part, my question is what causes allergy? Greetings to you all and I wish you well as you attempt those questions. May God be with us and bless us."
-181,167,1,86,2,88,0,7,Peer supervisor,"Welcome back fellow members, thanks for today's work and that of the weekend. This is reply to today's question. First of all that patient has a hearing loss. What I would do in my capacity is to refer him to an ENT specialist and advising him to get hearing aids. That's what I can do about it."
-183,167,1,79,2,96,0,8,Peer supervisor,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work. This is my reply to the question. If Miss Annette insists on me giving her antibiotics, I tell her it will bring problems for her since her condition doesn't need them. I tell her I would if she had pus or any other discharge, or had a perforation on the ear drum. The advice I can give her is to go to seeta Nazigo health centre for further examination and treatment. I personally don't have the treatment for it."
-172,168,1,77,2,93,0,2,Facilitator, Good morning VHTs. Did you have a good weekend? Thanks for all your work. We are now back to our cases which we always have after 2 weeks. 
168,168,1,86,2,85,0,3,Peer supervisor,"Greetings to you all. When I go to see that lady in kirujja butoke, I first introduce myself to her i.e Who I am and what I do. I ask her what she would like us to do because she may not want an ear wash out or she may want a specialist instead of me. I seek her permission and also explain to her that I can do it. When she grants me permission,  I examine her ears. If I discover there's discharge, I explain to her that we are going to wash those ears, dry them and then put antibiotics. Three drops three times a day for five days. I take the history in my book that has three sheets of carbon. When I'm done taking the history, I give her one copy and advise her to keep it. It helps me while doing follow up. I take another copy to the health centre and keep one in the book. After that, I ask for her names, the people who are apart of her household, her age, village, number of people in her household, how long she's had the condition and the treatment she's had so far. I ask her if she has any allergy. If she says yes, I request her not to use the medicine because it may cause complications. If she says no, I ask her to go ahead and use it. After 5 days, I go back to follow up."
170,170,1,100,2,68,0,-2,Facilitator,"Thanks Dorothy. Actually, this hole behind the ear is a 'post-auricular fistula'. It can be a result of an untreated cholesteatoma, but the hole itself is not called cholesteatoma."
-182,170,1,86,2,90,0,6,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. The way I see that child, I have no treatment for her condition as a VHT. I am not a qualified health worker therefore can't be permitted to treat her. The advice I can give to the mother is to take the child to a big health centre immediately. I can go ahead and escort her as well because her child's health is in danger at that moment. That's my reply to today's question."
171,171,1,88,2,83,0,0,CHW,"Good morning fellows. This is my answer to today's question. The advice I can give to Patricia's mother to prevent diarrhoea is as follows: don't eat left overs left out in the sun, wash hands with soap after going to the latrine, boil water, only just clean water sources, cook food properly. "
-171,171,3,83,1,46,2,42,CHW,"This is my suggestion regarding the malnourished child that was found in Makata. We shouldn't deal with just the mum because she has mental issues. I know the child has a father though he's also not okay and a grandparent called Baraza. I suggest VHTs within that area should explain to both the grandparent and father the situation at hand. They should tell them the child is malnourished and was referred to the health centre so that they also get involved. If they don't get involved, then a good samaritan will have to accompany them and stay with them in case they are admitted. If there's one, that's good but the child's relatives would have been the best. That's my opinion."
171,171,1,92,2,81,0,2,CHW,"I would like to thank my fellow VHTs reply to the question yesterday. I have seen todays question of the 50 year old woman who has a problem with itching but the ears are normal inside. Here yesterday we said some of the causes are old age, not cleaning it enough. Since the lady has no wax, I will give her olive oil. They say she needs to apply it two or three times a day. For 3-5 days. After that she goes back to the VHT for a washout. The itching is caused my so many things, infections, heat. Ok that is what I have to say. You apply oil. She might have used sticks. Thanks very much.  "
173,173,1,88,2,85,0,0,CHW," Greetings to you all. Just like my fellows, diarrhoea at home can be prevented by mothers encouraging their children to wash their hands before eating anything and after visiting the latrine. They should also avoid eating dirty things like unwashed mangoes, defecate in latrines and not anywhere else, drink boiled water and also cover food to prevent it from contamination by cockroaches."
175,175,1,93,2,92,0,10,Facilitator,"
Hello VHTs. Thank you for all of your hard work. This case is designed around the feedback you have been providing us. It concerns itching ears. You go to see a patient in Makata called Annette who is 50 years old. She is complaining of both ears itching. You take a history and examine her. She has been bothered by itching in her ears for the last 5 months. She has no pus and no wax in her ears. When you look inside the ear with your otoscope it looks normal.  

Q1. What do you think the causes of ear itching could be?"
-174,176,1,86,2,89,0,-1,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. Malnutrition is when a child is not fed on a balanced diet. A balanced diet refers to food with all nutrients for example posho. A child has to be given food with all nutrients so malnutrition depends on what the parents of the children feed them. Some parents do not ensure that the food given to their children is balanced. In my community, the condition is called kwashiokor. The other question is about the causes of malnutrition. Most of the time we live in poor conditions. We would love to feed our children on a balanced diet but we cannot afford it. That's my answer to the question."
176,176,1,95,2,81,0,0,Facilitator,"Jane, I can't see the paper very well from your photo. The first 6 questions you have not filled them correctly. If you find wax in the ear canal you don’t tick normal, but thank you. "
177,177,1,104,2,87,0,14,Facilitator,Hi vhts. I am writing a diahorrea case today as per Harriet's request.  I am so sorry for delaying the case. I've just had a really busy few days. But I will send it to Catherine today and I'll be back in makata on Monday
177,177,1,98,2,77,0,-2,CHW,"Greetings to you all and this is my reply to the question.
A. The biggest cause of hearing loss in Mukono district is sickness which affects their bodies. Medication causes the problem too. Inserting sticks in their ears to remove wax and stone quarries also cause hearing loss. B. Yes, people are discouraged when there are no hearing aids or if they're unable to afford them. C. As VHTs, what we can do is to advise people on how to prevent ear problems that can cause hearing loss. I also call upon the government to offer free treatment for people with hearing loss or to reduce on the tax of hearing aids during their importation to Uganda so they are affordable. They should also deploy more ENT specialists in government health centres. That's my reply to today's questions. Thanks so much."
-181,179,2,91,1,89,0,1,Facilitator,"Well done to the following VHTs for successfully answering questions today: Luke, Edward, Karl, Matthew, Nora, Dorothy, Isabella. The next part of the case will be released tomorrow morning and the answer provided by Catherine at 8pm"
179,179,1,91,2,89,0,1,Facilitator,"Thanks VHTs - the correct answer is that because Enochs measurement using the tape showed 'Red' you should refer him urgently to the health centre for thorough assessment. Similarly, for his sister; Refer. Any child with swollen feet on both sides should be referred to the health centre. "
181,181,1,91,2,89,0,-1,Peer supervisor,Greetings fellow members. The question requires us to give the causes of acute otitis media. It is mostly caused when the ear drum bursts. Those children are likely to suffer from severe malaria too because their bodies are not strong enough to fight against diseases.
-193,181,1,92,2,95,0,6,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. I can tell that child is malnourished if he has thin hair, swollen body, pale skin, sad face and stunted growth. Those are some of the symptoms of malnutrition I can give."
182,182,1,101,2,78,0,-3,Facilitator,"Greetings VHTs - thanks to all those who replied to todays question. The question was talking about poor feeding in children. The first one was asking what is malnutrition. When a child does not get enough food to eat to help them grow, develop or fight disease. When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar 
•	They are ill e.g. they have HIV
•	They do not have access to enough food 
•	They are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months
•	Not receiving routine vaccines
•	Lack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein "
182,182,1,93,2,90,0,1,CHW,"Greetings my brothers and sisters whom we work with. My bosses, good morning and well done. Now after checking the child and seeing all those symptoms with diarrhoea at the same time, I first advise the mother to encourage the child to drink even if their appetite is low beginning with ORS. I then advise her to get passion fruit juice since some children get fade up of ORS and prefer that instead. They need to take it frequently to prevent drying of the mouth. After that, I refer them to the health centre where they can be admitted but I advise them to keep drinking almost every second. That's how I can help the mother of the three year old child. May God be with you."
183,183,1,95,2,93,0,5,CHW,"Well done VHTs; I am sorry I am having network issues with my phone. I sent my reply but it delays to send. I am sorry. For todays case my answer is this - that lady Annette when I examine it and it has no wax, pus, hole but has itching I tell her that there might be fungus making the ear itch. In the field some people call you, you examine them but just have itching. Others have wax, but with itching in the ear. And others have normal ear drums but itching in the ear. I also remember we talked about this issue and we said people are always asking you for treatment. So for us we say Bryan, Catherine and Dr, Andrew give us the right answer and give us the medicine that can heal the itching in the ear. There is a man I know - his ear has things like dust which also brings itching in the ear. Even if they use sticks to clean their ears. But they can't use the sticks if the ears are not itching. Which means they have an issue with their ears. Even me I am also one of them. Before I was washed out it also used to itch me sometimes - that is why someone can try to insert something in the ear which can damage it. So we don't have a perfect answer; I just refer them to the specialist so they can be assessed properly. That is my view - have a good night. I have an issue with the network "
183,183,1,93,2,87,0,-3,Facilitator,"Thank you the causes of hearing loss are: Medications (e.g. certain antibiotics cause hearing loss if the dose is too high like gentamycin), loud noises, old age (prebycusis), infections (measles and mumps) are some of the causes of hearing loss. "
184,184,1,93,2,91,0,0,CHW,"Greetings and thanks for the work you're doing. Now, today's question requires us to define malnutrition regarding the child called Enoch that we saw from Kavule who was looking very thin. Malnutrition is when someone eats the same type of food daily instead of eating the three different types of food. The three different types of food  include body building food, energy giving food and one that fights against diseases. If you miss out on any of that, you become malnourished. There are people who eat cold food. Cold food is not useful to the body and causes swelling of cheeks and loss of body weight especially amongst children. Eating little food also causes malnutrition therefore one must eat food that's enough for their bodies. In my community, the condition is called ""musana"". It is common amongst children because their bodies are still developing and their immunity lowers if they don't get the right amounts of food I mentioned. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much."
-190,184,1,91,2,96,0,3,CHW,"Greetings ladies and gentlemen. Thanks Catherine for the work you're doing. For today's picture this is my reply. Most times people are born with that hole because my child has it too on both ears but it has no problem. But incase I find someone with it and with discharge or itching, I advise them to buy antibiotic tablets in order to ease the pain. That hole is called pre auricular sinus. Many people have it but it has no problem. That's what I have to say about today's photo."
-211,185,1,99,2,99,0,13,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers and our three bosses. Welcome back from where you were. Thanks Catherine for translating for us yesterday's question. Now for today's question of Joyce and her mother, once I find she has acute otitis media I can't handle it as a VHT. What I can do is to refer them to a specialists who can help them. That's my opinion since we are sharing ideas and learning. It's me your fellow health worker Johnson Matthew. Have a good day."
-197,185,1,92,2,99,0,6,CHW," Greetings ladies and gentlemen and thanks for the work. I am called Isabella Kizza. I think that patient might have been affected while still young for example    with malaria or yellow fever. When I examine him and I find he has that problem, I refer him to a specialist. Thanks."
-218,186,1,101,2,101,0,16,CHW," Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. When I check Enoch and the MUAC tape indicates he is severely malnourished, I advise the mother to take him to the health centre immediately since his condition is critical. The advice I can give the mother regarding the sister is to take good care of her by giving her body building food, energy giving food, drinks, milk and millet porridge since she ain't that badly off. All she needs is proper care. That's what I have to say today."
186,186,1,100,2,85,0,-1,CHW,"The treatment I can give to Patricia who I find out is dehydrated after checking  is mixing for her ORS. After giving her the ORS, I study her situation and if the diarrhoea stops, I don't refer her. If it doesn't stop, I refer her to the nearest health centre for treatment. Thanks so much."
-183,187,1,91,2,94,0,-2,Facilitator,Good morning VHTs. Here is todays question. How can you recommend community members to prevent malaria? Do you have any questions about malaria or this case which you are uncertain of and would like us to answer?
-190,188,1,92,2,97,0,1,Facilitator,Gordon thanks for your reply but what is the amount of olive oil you put in the ears and how many times do you apply it. Also what advice would you give to the patient?
188,188,1,97,2,93,0,2,CHW,"Good morning fellow VHTs. As Gordon, this is how I can advise my community to prevent malaria. They should sleep under mosquito nets. Everyone must have one on their beds. They need to clear bushes around their houses and remove any bottles that may retain water where mosquitoes could breed from. They should also have screen nets in the ventilators so that mosquitoes are unable to pass through them. They need to close the windows too before it gets dark. Those are some of the ways I can tell people to prevent malaria."
189,189,1,96,2,94,0,1,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. When I look at that patient, I see a pre-auricular sinus that may need surgery. I give the patient panadol for pain relief and then refer them to ENT specialists for treatment. I can also see the pinna itself and the tragus are  swollen. That's my answer to today's question."
189,189,1,101,2,90,0,2,Peer supervisor," Greetings fellow health workers. Now this is my answer to today's question. I would first of all advise Enoch's mother  to take that child for immunisation like my fellows have mentioned. The symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, swollen cheeks, pot belly and sometimes swollen arms. Such children tend to be sickly and take long to heal even with treatment. Another symptom is low body weight for their age. Also, they are always sad and do not play with others and they look tired all the time. If you lay them down on their bellies, the skin from their thighs to the buttocks becomes wrinkled. That's how I can tell if Enoch is malnourished."
189,189,1,99,2,94,0,4,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers whom we do this work with and our bosses. This is my reply to that question. If that child is found with malaria, I need to get them coartem. I ask the mother to give them three tablets twice a day for three days. I also ask her to give them one panadol each time they are swallowing it and then advise her to give them milk, groundnuts and other foods rich in proteins given how strong coartem is. They should be given passion fruit juice too to get better."
191,191,1,106,2,105,0,20,CHW,"Good morning fellow members. Thanks for today and yesterday's work. We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine."
-193,191,1,94,2,98,0,1,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs. I have also seen the question and thank my fellows who have already answered. The questions I can ask the mother include....if she has given the child ORS or fluids and if she has taken her to the health centre. The symptoms of dehydration I can look out for are body weakness. Actually the person can hardly stand and appears like they are dizzy. Secondly, the child has sunken eyes. Others include dry skin, low appetite, heavy eyes and can neither lift their legs nor handle anything with their hands due to body weakness. Those are some of the symptoms."
193,193,1,103,2,93,0,3,Facilitator,"Good morning VHTs - here is the third part of the case. You ask Patricias mother the questions. She tells you she has had diahorrea for 3 days, with 5 stools in the last 24 hours. She is tired, has not passed much urine. When you examine her her eyes are sunken and she has a dry mouth. 

Question: How do you want to treat her?"
-192,194,1,95,2,98,0,-1,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for the work you're doing. Thanks to those who have replied to the question. I won't differ so much from my fellows on the issue of Annette who has itching ears. Truth is some people feel like they know a lot more than everyone else so they can push one into doing something that may cause damage to them. If she insists she needs the antibiotic drops yet I checked her ears and found nothing, truth is I don't give them to her. If you apply medicine without any disease it becomes poison and I cannot give someone poison that would be harmful to them. I explain to her that I can't give her the medicine because it's not necessary for her condition and then refer her to specialists to find out the cause. That's how I can explain to her personally."
-198,194,1,95,2,101,0,2,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. Well done Andrew, Bryan and Catherine. I have just seen the question. From the symptoms, I first ask the mother to take the child for blood check up. If the tests are negative I give the child pain killers. Sometimes malaria causes ear pain. Now when I look at the picture, I can see the ear drum is swollen. I can also see some red dish part that appears like it will soon produce pus. That's what I am personally seeing. Thank you so much. I love you and I am with you spiritually. I will keep answering the questions and will see you when I get back."
1,195,1,98,3,86,2,11,CHW,"Greetings VHTs - thanks for todays work. Today I managed to visit my houses. I found a boy of 20 years. One ear has a hearing loss, after the ear got a problem after using quinine tablets when he was still young. It affected his ear when I looked into the ear. It looks like he has a problem with the ear drum. I didn't manage to do a washout, because I didn't have the equipment to do dry mopping. "
-213,197,1,100,2,105,0,8,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs. Apologies for taking long to reply to the question. Thanks for yesterday's work. Miss Catherine and Bryan, I send my regards to you. Thanks for serving and loving us. This is my reply to today's question. The biggest cause of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono is sickness like severe malaria especially amongst children. You decide to go to the health centre, line up till 3pm and by the time they get to you the child is worse. They give you quinine tablets to give to them but you're too poor to afford drinks so in the process, the child ends up losing their hearing."
-201,197,1,98,2,101,0,2,Peer supervisor,"Greetings to you my fellows and thank you for the work you're doing. That disease of acute otitis media is beyond me but because of the pain the child feels, I advise the mother to give her some pain killers like panadol to feel better. I then refer them to ENT specialists for treatment before the disease worsens."
-201,199,1,97,2,103,0,1,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing for the country. For those who had patients and they got well, we thank God. And for those who are still sick, may God see you through. Now when I look at that photo, the condition is called fungal otitis externa and it's in our books if you read. Regards to you all and I wish you a blessed and peaceful day tomorrow. May God enable us to wake up alive. Good bye."
201,201,2,92,1,109,0,0,Facilitator,Happy Easter to you all and thanks for the good work. I am going to arrange an in-person training day at Seeta Nazigo in 2 weeks time to deliver more training for you all and to go over all of the answers for things in the case group.
-199,201,1,99,2,101,0,-1,Facilitator,Good morning VHTs. Hope you are ok. Todays question concerning malaria is as follows: The RDT shows she has malaria. How do you treat malaria in this girl? 
-202,202,3,75,2,91,1,36,Peer supervisor,"Greetings fellows. Today they have asked us to share or ask anything related to the ear project. I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr.Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much."
202,202,1,107,2,100,0,5,CHW,"Thanks VHTs for the work you are doing for the country. After explaining to that gentleman his condition and then he asks for the treatment needed, I ask him to go to bigger hospital like Mulago where there are specialists. Those specialists can examine him again for hearing. I also explain to him those are the people who will give him treatment. I call those people ENT specialists. They can give him hearing aids or carry out surgery. That is the advice I can give him because at that point his condition is beyond me. Thank you so much. "
202,202,1,101,2,99,0,-2,Peer supervisor,"Greetings members thanks for todays work. Those in pain - I pray you are healed. The question was saying after telling Annette, the situation is like this - based on her age. She is in her 50s - her source of income might be low. If I have money I can buy medicine for her. Then I inform her I don't have enough but I bought you the first dose. Another thing I do - I refer her to the hospital to see that she gets the medicine. The next question said, do you think ppl should buys medicines for themselves, I say yes because they needto care about themselves before the illness gets worse. Another thing - it helps them to be responsible for their lives. Because if they keep waiting for something for free, they don't care enough. Yet, the illness gets worse. Another thing, is because in the government hospitals the medicine is not there. When you reach there they tel you to buy the medcine yourself. But on the other side, it is in the governments responsiblity to protect and look after its people. Another thing is that people shouldn't buy medicine for themselves because they pay tax. "
203,203,1,107,2,96,0,0,CHW,Good morning fellow health workers and thank God for this day.This is my answer to today's question. We must encourage people to sleep under treated mosquito nets. We should ask them to buy them if they can't get them from the health centre. They need to drain stagnant water around them too. Stagnant water is a breeding place for mosquitoes. They should also close their windows early and put screen nets on them. That's what I have to say about today's question.
-212,204,1,102,2,106,0,4,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work. Good morning Miss Catherine, Mr. Bryan and the VHTs. Thanks for answering yesterday's question and the rest of the work you're doing. Question A. Yes, we meet so many deaf people. Just like the gentleman we talked about, there are so many causes of hearing loss for example sickness, use of strong medicine, accidents, getting beaten and poor treatment. Some people apply herbal medicine to their ears. Others ignore infections thinking they will cure by themselves. That's how I've answered the first question. It's me VHT Johnson Matthew."
204,204,1,106,2,98,0,0,CHW,"Well done fellow VHTs. Forgive me for taking long to reply to this question. My data was loaded on MTN yet the sim card wasn't inserted in. I also spent a lot of time at the health centre treating patients. Thanks a lot Andrew. Now this is my answer to today's question. I won't differ so much from my fellows. I must sensitize people in my community about sleeping under mosquito nets. Others include clearing bushes around their homes, draining stagnant water that is sometimes caused by brick laying, avoid planting maize near their houses because mosquitoes breed from there, collecting and burning tins and completing the dose once one suffers from malaria. People swallow half way and assume they are okay because they feel better. My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? The other advice I can give to them is to close windows when it gets dark. May be avoiding using dirty utensils for food and eating cold food. That's what I have to say."
-199,205,1,98,2,104,0,-3,CHW," Good morning VHTs. Welcome back from yesterday's meeting and thanks for sharing your ideas. Forgive me for not attempting yesterday's question. It's because my phone's battery was dead. As for today's question that is a continuation of that of yesterday, hearing loss is sometimes inborn, sometimes it's as a result of sickness or accidents and many other problems. That's my view and thanks so much for listening to me. Have a good day VHTs. It's me your fellow VHT Johnson Matthew from Makata."
208,208,1,105,2,101,0,-2,CHW, Greetings fellows. I can tell whether Enoch is malnourished if his skin is wrinkled. Malnourished children also have potty bellies. They also appear weak and tend to be sleepy all the time. That's my reply.
-207,209,1,104,2,104,0,-1,CHW,"Greetings fellow health workers. Thanks for everything you're doing. I can see that child has the same condition my fellow VHTs have mentioned which is a pre-auricular sinus. If I have pain killers, I can give them but from how I see their condition, they need surgery. My thoughts on that don't differ from what my fellows have said since our ability is limited. Good night. It's me your fellow health worker Johnson Matthew from Makata. Thank you."
210,210,1,107,2,106,0,3,CHW, I greet you all fellow VHTs. I am called Patricia and thanks for the work you're doing.I was unable to answer yesterday's question because I saw them late and my phone's battery was down. The treatment I would give to the mother for the child are anti bacteria drops.
210,210,1,106,2,100,0,-4,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs. Today's question is still about Enoch. If I use the MUAC tape and it shows the red colour, I refer the child to a health centre for treatment. There are various foods available for malnourished children. For the sister whose reading for the MUAC tape is green but is thin and has swollen feet, I still refer her. Her feeding may be okay but when she suffers from something else. I therefore refer her to the health centre for further diagnosis. Thanks so much."
-210,212,1,102,2,109,0,-1,CHW,"How has your day been fellow VHTs? Thanks for the work you're doing for the country. Catherine, Bryan and Andrew, my regards to you. Thanks fellow VHTs for answering yesterday's questions. This is my answer to today's questions. The questions I would ask the mother of the child include how long the child has had the diarrhoea, if their stool is bloody or watery and if they have had any treatment like Oral Rehydration Salt"
-210,212,1,103,2,108,0,-1,CHW,"Thanks all VHTs for today work thanks for replying to todays case. Thanks you for Catherine and Bryan for the work you are doing for us. The one greeting you is Qiana Kigwana. This is how I reply my first question. In Mukono the reason why we have people with hearing problems is because some parents when they get pregnant they don't want to go to hospitals for check up - then the kids get ill. Some used to go to private shops and buy qunine and swallow - yet malaria is too much. So after taking the quinine they take too much of it so by the moment that they produce that child they come out with a hearing issue. Another thing someone can produce a child who hears very well, but sometimes the child gets sick but gets too much malaria then they get treatment with qunine then the quinine becomes too much because my inlaws child has this issue. They always advise them to use qunine which is why the child does not hear, yet the child was good but these days we use sign language. Now he is in S1, but he was produced when he was normal but the problem was quinine. Quinine was the medicine every just took without even knowing if it was the right one. Even pregnant women. But because when pregnant women go to hospitals they get a different drug. "
213,213,1,108,2,104,0,-1,CHW,"Good morning fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work and we thank God for keeping us alive till now. Now, this is my reply to today's question. After explaining to him the causes of hearing loss, I let him know that he needs a specialist for treatment because his condition is beyond our capacity. They may get him hearing aids or something else."
-205,213,1,104,2,105,0,-4,CHW," Greetings to you all fellow VHTs. I can also see that disease is called pre-auricular sinus. If the patient tells me they feel pain, I advise them to get pain killers to reduce the pain. I also refer them to specialists for further treatment. That's what I have to say. Thank you."
213,213,1,105,2,104,0,-4,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work. I apologize for not replying to yesterday's question. My neighbor lost their sibling and there's no way I would reply to the question. I have actually just seen it today but this is my reply to today's question.  Here is what causes malaria. First of all, it is transmitted by a female anopheles mosquito. Secondly, typhoid is caused by eating dirty things and drinking unboiled water. That is how I've answered today's question."
-213,215,1,105,2,109,0,-1,CHW,"How's your day fellow health workers? Well done! I was unable to reply to yesterday's question but this is what I have to say about it. When a mother comes to me and explains the symptoms their child has like high temperature, rapid breathing, pain in the limbs, from what I know I just advise her to take the child to the health centre for further examination. Observation and assumptions are not enough. I may think it's malaria yet it's something else so they need to go for blood check up to identify what type of malaria it is. As a VHT I don't have the equipments for blood check up neither do I have a thermometer to measure body temperature. That's my reply to yesterday's question."
216,216,1,110,2,102,0,-4,Facilitator,Good morning VHTs. Thank you for the work. This is the time for todays question. You give the treatment of ear wash out and antibiotic drops. You visit a few weeks later but it is not better. What do you do now?
-157,217,1,85,2,102,3,30,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. I found a malnourished child here that is carried by the mum in the photo above. He looks exactly as you see him in the photo. I am planning on checking him using the MUAC tape but have no one to help me shoot the video. I am home alone with my kids, and the mum to the patient doesn't know how to do it yet I cannot shoot it while checking. If there's any VHT around, please come help me. Also, I don't know why I am missing  some VHTs' contacts like Nalongo Isabella, Karl and others. I went to Karl's place to seek for his help but didn't find him. Edward is in Seeta so if there's any VHT around who can get to me in 40 minutes, please do because I need help.  Catherine or Bryan if you're also able,  please come help me and we check this child using the MUAC tape and also advise the mother on how to feed or treat her malnourished child. Thank you."
-224,224,1,94,3,100,2,30,CHW,Greetings to you all VHTs. I found a patient called X. The problem she has is that the ear is swollen like you see in the picture and it is painful. She is in so much pain. I would like feedback from Andrew. 
-218,228,1,108,2,115,0,-5,Facilitator,Thank you Qiana. But the lower part we have not yet reached. Thank you very much.
