Acknowledgement	Greetings	CHW	Peer supervisor	"Greetings Edward, thanks for the work you are doing."
Encouragement	Case study - feedback 	Facilitator	CHW	"Ok Francesca, who do you think is responsible?"
Logistics	Acknowledgement	CHW	Peer supervisor	Edward I got your information so let me wait for this man. I have got the information very well. 
Case study - response	Logistics	CHW	Group	And now fellow VHTs I have reached Mrs. Xs place. But her ear is so bad. One is very very bad. The left one has pus doesn't look good. Tomorrow Andrew will see her when he goes for the home visit. 
Case study - response	Greetings	CHW 	Group	Greetings to you all fellow health workers. I am happy for the correction from my fellow health workers about something I thought was right. Thank you so much for that.
Peer-to-peer problem solving	Management of a patient	Peer supervisor 	CHW	"Aunt Francesca I request if you can, please take a photo of that child and share it with us here. We shall discuss it when we meet and our boss will see how to handle it. You know some of our people still overlook us. They haven't yet discovered how important we are. They love different people so if our boss accepts and we go there with him, they can probably soften their hearts. Remember a prophet is never respected where they are born. If that child gets help, they will then see the importance."
Case study - response	Case study - feedback 	Facilitator	Group	"Greetings VHTs - thanks to all those who replied to todays question. The question was talking about poor feeding in children. The first one was asking what is malnutrition. When a child does not get enough food to eat to help them grow, develop or fight disease. When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar 
•	They are ill e.g. they have HIV
•	They do not have access to enough food 
•	They are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months
•	Not receiving routine vaccines
•	Lack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein "
Case study - response	Logistics	CHW	Group	I was in X's home treating some people with ear problems. After I moved around but didn't find any other person with ear problems so I went back home.
Case study - feedback 	Management of a patient	Facilitator 	CHW	"Well spotted Karl (I actually missed that sinus myself !!) I think it's a sinus yes, but also otitis externa. Fully agree with your management plan of antibiotics. I'll be at seeta nazigo HC 9am on Monday Edward and will supply them."
Peer-to-peer problem solving	Logistics	CHW	Facilitator	Mr. Andrew I don't have consent forms to use on my home visit. 
Case study - feedback 	Acknowledgement	Facilitator	CHW	"Thank you Harriet, now what can you do for the child? "
Logistics	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Peer supervisor 	CHW	"Francesca I am asking you to take responsibility and we go together for the second time. Last time they saw a different face, this time they will see a different one. I am sure those people know us but I will speak with them again. If they refuse, we let them be. It's true they told us not to take people's photos before asking for their permission and not to insist on treating patients if they don't want. If we try to help them but they show no interest, we should just leave them. Let me know when you think they will be there so we can meet and talk to them. They could be knowing its importance but wondering why we are over insisting. I am waiting for you."
Case study - feedback 	Management of a patient	Facilitator	CHW	"Dr Doreen said they also need If not, Ampiclox syrup and pain relief such as panadol. Luke can you make sure the person is informed and aware ? It is important."
Peer-to-peer problem solving	Case study - response	CHW 	Group	I Luke. The first thing I do incase there is no change is to refer the child to specialists because there is nothing else I can do. So I send the child to Mulago. 
Peer-to-peer problem solving	Logistics	CHW	CHW	Isabella I came across people with a lot of wax. I have made it clear I think it in the other message. 
Case study - response	Case study - asking a question	Facilitator	Group	"Good morning VHTs and thanks for the work. This case is focussed on malnutrition in children.

2.	Know the importance and causes of malnutrition (Monday) 
3.	Recognise the signs of malnutrition in a child  (Tuesday) 
4.	Know how to use a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tape to assess a child for malnutrition (Wednesday) 
5.	Know the basic management plan for a child with suspected malnutrition identified in the community (Thursday)
6.	Know the important health messages they can give to caregivers to about nutrition (Friday) 

Case: You are on a home visit in Kavuule with your supervisor. At this house there is a 8 month old baby boy, Enoch. You are worried that he looks very thin and want to assess him for malnutrition.

Case study - feedback 	Peer-to-peer problem solving	Peer supervisor 	Peer supervisor	"As you can't do the ear wash out due to the pain, refer her to health center to get the pain killer and then give Antibiotics for a week. Apply 3 drops by 3 times a day."
Case study - asking a question	Case study - response	CHW 	Group	"How's your day fellow VHTs? Thanks for all the work. Thank God for getting us through the holiday and for keeping us alive. This is my reply to today's question as Hadijja. I can see a head with an ear that has a swollen pinna. That disease is called haematoma. When I find such a patient, I refer them to a specialist because they need surgery. Greetings and I wish you well as you reply to the question. May God be with you."
Logistics	Peer-to-peer problem solving	CHW	Peer supervisor	"Another thing; remind them in May that there will be an ear camp at Seeta Nazigo. The doctors are coming - ENT. Also I think let the patients give you their phone number, the mum. Then you call her once we know the date. "
Case study - response	Management of a patient	Facilitator 	Group	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.
Thanks	Acknowledgement	CHW	Facilitator 	Well done Miss Catherine. We have understood the questions but most of the VHTs are now in the garden planting because it rained. We have understood the questions and we shall reply. Thanks so much.
