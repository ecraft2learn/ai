Greetings VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. Now, there's a lady in Makata who went to Seeta but I'm not sure who she found there because she was referred to us to treat her and give her a form. Doctor told us not to see any new patients without working on those we saw on Sunday.  Greetings Francesca.

The problems we find when e have gone on house visits are the ones we are supposed to share on the VHT case group, but when we keep doing the same mistake as they are always telling us, it is not good let's observe before sharing messages, but issues with illnesses when you get the patient are the ones to go in the case group, whereas informing others where you will meet and any other information should be  written in Seeta Nazigo Makata group, thank you so much."

Thanks for today's work. Thank God who has kept us. Good morning our bosses Dr Andrew, Bryan, Catherine and Hannah. Thank you for the work you're doing for us. VHTs and our bosses, I would like your advice. In case one day I kill a snake and then after leave it somewhere, and then the insects eat apart of it but again comeback to my house.  In case those insects get in contact with things that I eat,  is it poisonous? Or if they bite me after eating the snake? Does it affect me? What happens exactly? Please advise me because a lot of people in my village may fall prey. That's my question. I request fellow VHTs, Doctor, Bryan, Catherine please tell me because I personally don't know.

Luke please explain to us where we should communicate from and not in a bad way. I also found a lot of sympathy messages and I sympathised as well so I am probably one of those who did wrong.

And if yes, doesn't it affect someone when the pus hides somewhere in the ear? Can't the pus go through the mouth and accidentally someone eats it and gets another problem? Am still wondering about this and it confuses me whereby I need to learn more, and lastly the holes in the ear drum, how are they caused?"

Quality assurance	Communication and information - making a request	Supportive environment - thanks	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings my fellow VHTs, Am the usual person greeting you as you know my name, according to me, what we need to know more about is how to use the hook to remove the wax, I humbly request for a training in how to use the hook to remove the wax, because most of the patients I have found, you may give them olive oil and when you are going to washout, you find the wax when it has moved near the ear canal at the entrance which may need to be removed by the hook. I would suggest that we get training about using the hook and after that we get pain killers because truly, people know that the treatment is for free as you know things of Uganda and also a village can not be the same as it is in town, if someone expects that treatment is free and the person comes with a problem with the ears, when the person has pain, and itching, you examine the patient may be you find when the ears are normal but with itching and pain or when they have any abnormalities but sincerely the patient goes back with only olive oil without any pain killers to reduce on the pain and yet you trained us about the pain killers. I request Doctor to add that in our work so that our work can be good instead of someone coming and complaining that I took my ears thinking they are going to help me, I had pain and yet they are telling me to go and buy pain killers for 1000 shillings to relieve the pain. I would suggest that we get the pain killers, or capsules like dicrophenac or panadol, like if we are given a tin of panadol tablets such that a patient can go when he/she has the pain killers and the guidance on how to use them alongside olive oil if they have wax, other than someone saying they examined me but I didn't get any treatment yet I have pain, now like the patient I referred to Bryan, up to now he says the ears are still itching, he is using olive oil and he will be washed out tomorrow. Or if there is medicine which can be used to reduce itching in the ear, they should be given to us so that we are sure that we have tackled the problems of ears because you told us that if a person has itching in the ear, leave him or without wax, so shall we leave the person to use sticks because we have no where else to reffer them, I request Andrew to make that improvement, that's what I think and also my colleagues that I work with. Thank you so muck Bryan"

May god provide you for everything you put your hand in. One more thing I call my upon my fellow VHTs to teach the patients very well. When we talk about oil we don't mean the oil for cars, because someone asked me whether they said can it be any oil e.g. cars, bodas. So the person said I have some oil in my jerry can at home. So I asked them which kind of oil and they said that for bodas. So the patient was wondering if we should use that one. So I told them do not put that in the ear. I told them, we put another kind of oil and we are the only ones to have it and give you directions about how to use it. The one you are talking about can bring harm to the ear. It is not meant for the ear, it is meant for automobiles. I request all the VHTs to inform the people. Tell them exactly what type of oil to use. I wish you a good day but as a reminder we have a meeting at 2pm at the HC today. I request all who have heard to inform a friend. "
