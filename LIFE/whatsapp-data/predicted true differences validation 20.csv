Thanks for not giving up on us Catherine and Bryan. Thanks for the responsibility. We really appreciate. Thanks for doing this project. There are so many people who have ear problems, but you have been able to help them. Even though some are still doubting I am sure they will get to know the project will help them. "
Case study - response,Request,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,Group,Why I am asking this question is because there are some organizations with the ability to equip their employees to work in rural areas especially those far away from the health centre. They train them to do blood check ups for malaria. Is it possible with us too? That's my question because you told us to ask any questions. Thank you.
Case study - response,Case study - feedback,Thanks,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator ,Group,"Thanks for the answers VHTs. The answers are as follows: Diarrhoea is 3 or more loose or watery stools in 1 day or Diarrhoea is a sign there is a germ in the belly. You can get diahorrea for all of the following reasons -	Eating foods prepared with water that is not clean or safe. Eating spoiled foods or uncooked meats; Children not washing hands; Caregivers not washing hands; Living in unclean conditions or too close to animals; Flies landing on uncovered food

Please come to the organisation to collect your tape off Bryan or Catherine this week. I will leave them with a supply for those VHTs who did not get one.
Case study - asking a question,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Reporting,Request,Thanks,NA,Facilitator ,Group,Hi VHTs - slight dilemma. We need your opinions on how to handle this matter. Harriet identified a malnourished child in Makata who had a red MUAC tape. The child is 10 months old. The mother has learning difficulties and has no money. She is not able to bring the child to the health centre where they will need to be for a few weeks while the child has the appropriate feed and medicine and is monitored. We have provided them with a referral letter but we want you to advise us  on what you think should be done. Thank you.
Case study - feedback,Peer-to-peer learning,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW ,CHW,"Harriet this is the answer to your question of why malaria may fail to be detected using RDT but a microscope instead. RDT is only used to check malaria. The microscope shows a lot including typhoid. You very well know here at Seeta Nazigo before they introduced RDT, the microscope couldn't detect malaria even when someone felt so much pain. Typhoid can hardly be seen in dispensary or government health centres. It's commonly detected in clinics."

Am waiting for your response, I am here with the patien"
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Patriotic message,Greetings,NA,NA,CHW,Group,"Greetings fellow VHTs. While on home visits, we encounter some challenges for example here in Makata there is a child whose ear is deformed. The parents don't agree with helping the child yet the child is for the country. Dorothy the supervisor also went there but the parents disagree with correcting it. What do you think we should do about it as VHTs who help people in the community?"
Case study - response,Management of a patient,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Clarifying message,Informal learning,Greetings,Thanks,Peer supervisor,Group,"Greetings fellows. Today they have asked us to share or ask anything related to the ear project. I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr.Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much."
Encouragement,Greetings,Religion,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW ,Group,Ok my fellow VHTs have a good night and may God be with you. 
Case study - response,Case study - feedback,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator ,Group,"Hi VHTs. Here are some suggestions about how to prevent diahorrea: Breastfeed more frequently when a baby has diarrhoea.

Give more fluids to children with diarrhoea.

Giving oral rehydration salts solution can strengthen a child and reduce the risk of death from diarrhoea.

Prevent diarrhoea by disposing of all faeces in a latrine 

Wash hands with soap before preparing or handling food, before eating or feeding a child. after using the toilet or changing a child who has defecated, before and after taking care of someone who is sick, after touching sick or dead animals

Use safe water for drinking and food preparation

Do not drink water from any source directly without boiling it 

Safe water can be made unsafe if carried in dirty containers or stored in dirty containers or left uncovered in clean containers

Protect water from contamination by covering water storage containers and keeping animals away.

Cook food well and protect it from flies.

Cover stored food.

Use clean eating utensils."

Case study - response,Case study - feedback,Greetings,THanks,Clarifying message,NA,NA,CHW ,Group,Thanks Madam Catherine for replying to me very well. The incorrect answer I saw was from Luke about ensuring children are put under a mosquito net by 6pm. I know the female mosquito that transmits malaria begins doing so at 3am not 6pm. If it was the case then all children would be sick. 6pm is too early and not only children suffer from malaria but also adults. What I have to say is we sleep under mosquito nets that ain't treated and that's why mosquitoes bite us. Sometimes they have holes. Anyway it is not right to say children should be put under mosquito nets by 12pm because adults are affected as well. That's what I want to clarify. Female mosquitoes bite from 3am. Regards to you all and I thank Madam Catherine for helping us reply to our questions very well.
Case study - feedback,Case study - asking a question,Greetings,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,Group,"Good morning. This is the final question for this case. There are no 'right or wrong' answers here. We wish to just see your views and opinions. Q4a. There are long ques and waiting times at Mulago Hospital to be seen by ENT surgeons. Do you think this makes patients avoid going to the hospital even if they need to? What other reasons do people give for not going to a big hospital like Mulago? Q4b. In Uganda in 2009 there were 16 ENT surgeons. In 2015 this number increase to 35, however this number is much lower than a county such as South Africa where there were 246 ENT surgeons in 2015. Why do you think Uganda faces this situation? Q4c. How do you we can we link the limited number of ENT surgeons to the community better so that patients who need surgeons input can be seen and followed up? "
Request,Reporting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,Facilitator,"Andrew there is a patient who has a lot of wax, the patient doesn't hear well, someone needs to talk facing the patient before the he or she hears."
