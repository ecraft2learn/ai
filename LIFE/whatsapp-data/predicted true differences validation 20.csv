I am able to communicate now because someone helped me with the phone but it loses WhatsApp and blocks everything I try to do. Like I told you, Andrew and Bryan repaired it when we were at the health centre but it still bothers me that's why I am unable to reply to the questions. Thanks so much though for advising us. It's me your fellow health worker Johnson Matthew."
Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,CHW,Peer supervisor,"Mr Edward me too, my view is the same as that of Dorothy, olive oil and pain killers, if the pain doesn't stop then we can ask our in-charges  about what to do."

Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Peer supervisor,Group,"Greetings fellows. Today they have asked us to share or ask anything related to the ear project. I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr.Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much."

The may also need amoxicillin if they have upper respiratory tract infection. If the infection doesn't heal with antibiotic ear drops they may need something stronger - like oral flucloxacillin"

Case study - response,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Peer supervisor,Peer supervisor,"Thank you Edward, what I can say, the ear with wax needs olive oil and that with pain I think the person needs pain killers and we see how he will be. That is my idea."

You are on a home visit in Kirujja Butoke and you are asked to see a 35 year old woman. She is complaining of hearing loss in her left ear, some discharge that has not settled and  pain. 

Q1a. What are the things you need to do? Q1b. Where should you record the history?Q1c. What questions are important to ask in the history?  "
Case study - response,Case study - feedback ,Case study - logistics,Facilitator ,Group,Children who have otitis media a lot are more at risk of developing hearing loss later in life. The next question will be released tomorrow morning. Good night VHTs. 
Reporting,Logistics,NA,CHW,Facilitator,Mr. Andrew I don't have consent forms to use on my home visit. 
Case study - response,Reporting,Request,CHW,Group,Greetings to you all VHTs. I found a patient called X. The problem she has is that the ear is swollen like you see in the picture and it is painful. She is in so much pain. I would like feedback from Andrew. 
Case study - feedback ,Peer-to-peer problem solving,NA,CHW ,CHW, I would also like to correct Harriet. Brucella is not malaria but a disease of its own just like T.B.
Case study - feedback ,Logistics,Thanks,Facilitator,Peer supervisor,"Ah ok. Thank you for clarifying Edward. But yes, I will try get a supply of TP to supply to people for dry mopping. For cleaning the otoscopes we will supply alcohol wipes. "
Case study - feedback ,Case study - response,Thanks,Peer supervisor ,Group,Thanks for all the work you've done today fellows. I would tell Mr. Jamil that his condition of hearing loss needs examination by ENT specialists or hearing aids to amplify sounds. That's what I can do.
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Case study - feedback ,Encouragement,Facilitator,CHW,Good point. The cause of CSOM is due to poor hygiene sometimes so encourage parents to keep their childrens ears clean and dry.
Logistics,Encouragement,NA,Facilitator,CHW,Karl it is good we are hearing from you now but it is important for you to be regular with your replies. You shouldn't wait for your home visit to come online. You should try be on and contactable as much as possible. We were not blaming you we just wanted you to be on the same page as the rest of the VHTs.

Encouragement,Case study - asking a question,Encouragement,Facilitator ,Group,Can any VHT use their MUAC tape and demonstrate to others how to use it properly? We can then give you feedback!
Case study - response,Case study - feedback ,NA,Facilitator ,Group,"The answers are as follows. A: They should mention about introducing themselves to the patient, explaining the project to her, getting consent, making sure she understands the consent and then begin the process by taking a history. A: They should record their history in their history books. A: They should focus on the 6 questions in the history book e.g. Any ear pain (Yes or No), Any discharge (Yes or No), Any hearing loss (Yes or No), Itching (Yes or No), Dizziness (Yes or No), Tinnitus (Yes or No). "
Case study - response,Request,NA,CHW,Group,Why I am asking this question is because there are some organizations with the ability to equip their employees to work in rural areas especially those far away from the health centre. They train them to do blood check ups for malaria. Is it possible with us too? That's my question because you told us to ask any questions. Thank you.

Request,Reporting,Logistics,CHW,Facilitator,Hi Andrew. Good morning. I have a patient we were going to see today. He has a hearing loss and a swelling of the pinna and it has a perforation like a sinus on it. So I told them we will meet in town. Another patient does not hear. 
Request,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Reporting,CHW,Group,"There is a question I am asking my fellow VHTs. There is a house I have found a child. The boy is 10 years, but he is mentally disturbed. So I need your advice. Can I take the child to Andrew on Monday. I need advice because the child does not talk or hear - he is deaf. I need advice what can I do."
Case study - feedback ,Management of a patient,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW,CHW,"Catherine told us that the wound takes time to heal since its inside the ear, so you have to explain that to the patient as well such that she can go ahead with the treatment."
Case study - response,Reporting,Peer-to-peer problem solving ,CHW ,Group,"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. I found a malnourished child here that is carried by the mum in the photo above. He looks exactly as you see him in the photo. I am planning on checking him using the MUAC tape but have no one to help me shoot the video. I am home alone with my kids, and the mum to the patient doesn't know how to do it yet I cannot shoot it while checking. If there's any VHT around, please come help me. Also, I don't know why I am missing  some VHTs' contacts like Nalongo Isabella, Karl and others. I went to Karl's place to seek for his help but didn't find him. Edward is in Seeta so if there's any VHT around who can get to me in 40 minutes, please do because I need help.  Catherine or Bryan if you're also able,  please come help me and we check this child using the MUAC tape and also advise the mother on how to feed or treat her malnourished child. Thank you."

Case study - response,Reporting,Request,CHW,Group,"Good morning fellow VHTs. There is a patient who Dr. J sent me from my village. We worked on that child like you asked us to do, but this morning they brought him/her in a very bad condition. So much pus was coming out from their ears and they were feeling a lot of pain. We need your help because we did everything we could - we washed out, got them antibiotics etc. "

Management of a patient,Case study - feedback ,Encouragement,Facilitator,CHW , I can understand their frustration Nora. That is why having the medicines as VHTs and going house to house is so important. You build trust and respect of the community like how you are doing with Anna Nabwire the 97 year old lady who you are treating with antibiotic drops. Imagine how hard it would be for her to go to Seeta Nazigo 3 times a day for treatment with drops. You are giving her an excellent service.
Case study - response,Management of a patient,Peer-to-peer problem solving,CHW ,Group," I also greet you my fellow VHTs, thank you for the work you are doing, greetings Mrs Isabella, about that issue, as me Nora this is how I respond to you, I also had the same issue where Mrs Anna who got the same problem yet we had washed her out and gave antibiotics, but when she came back to me, I did what I was told in the meeting, I washed her again and gave her antibiotics, now she's feeling okay and she no longer her pus in the ear, I was suggesting may be you do the same to your patient, you do a washout and give her antibiotics, the pus will stop, I encourage other VHTs to give their ideas, thank you."
Case study - feedback ,Case study - response,Greetings,CHW ,Group,"Greetings to you all VHTs online and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my reply to the question. Patricia, a three year old child has diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is caused by a lot of things like typhoid and malaria. It refers to releasing watery stool since normal waste should be solid. If it contains some blood, it's called dysentry. I advise the mother to take the child to the health centre or I give them first aid of Oral Rehydration Salt ( 2 spoons of sugar and a pinch of salt mixed with water). That's what I can do. I also tell my community members that diarrhoea refers to waterly stool. That's how I have answered the question."
Encouragement,Logistics,Request,Facilitator,CHW,"Qiana, Oliver and Matthew - thank you for your effort but please ask others if you don't understand how you use your phone and contribute to the case groups.

One ear has a hearing loss, after the ear got a problem after using quinine tablets when he was still young. It affected his ear when I looked into the ear. It looks like he has a problem with the ear drum. I didn't manage to do a washout, because I didn't have the equipment to do dry mopping. "
Case study - asking a question,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Facilitator ,Group,Hi VHTs - slight dilemma. We need your opinions on how to handle this matter. Harriet identified a malnourished child in Makata who had a red MUAC tape. The child is 10 months old. The mother has learning difficulties and has no money. She is not able to bring the child to the health centre where they will need to be for a few weeks while the child has the appropriate feed and medicine and is monitored. We have provided them with a referral letter but we want you to advise us  on what you think should be done. Thank you.
