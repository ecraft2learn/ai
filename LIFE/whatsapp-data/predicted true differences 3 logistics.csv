He just needs to try secure the time off. This will be the same as the last meeting with Dr. Brenda where your patients with problems can be reviewed. Finally, Dr. Brenda has agreed to operate on patients for free in Mbarara. She can do one patient per week. I know Mbarara is a long distance however they will be guarenteed to be see by her, it will be on a set date meaning they can plan for the journey and they can be rest assured that they will receive all treatment for free."

Those who are ill, God will protect you. As you also care about yourself taking medicine. I want to inform you at this moment that Andrew is at the health centre. He wants to review all patients for those who have ones who need review. He apologised he was not able to be here yesterday as he had no mean of transport. But now he is here. Bring your patients so they can be seen. Because we are trying to prepare to see Dr. Simon and those ones who might go to Mbarara. It is better to see that we get all patients seen right now do they can be selected for the health centre. That is what I want to tell you. Don't loose this opportunity. I apologise to the patients who came yesterday, and didn't get treatment and inform them why they didn't get treatment because it is better for someone to know the reason - even if they didn't get what they wanted. I wish you a good day. "

I also thank Dr Andrew, and his translators Bryan and Catherine, thank you so much, you have tried so much to translate what is right from what we have been saying for example changing from English to Luganda and the vice versa"
Communication and information	Supportive environment	Supportive environment	Supportive Environment	NA	NA	No entry for sixSupervisoryCategory	Peer supervisor	" Greatings members, thank you for all you are doing to see that we develop our community in Health, now there is a problem which may not be good to our coordinators, the way people are responding to questions is not encouraging. Some VHTs are not replying to cases for example like yesterday, I encourage you to respond to the cases and answer the question the way you understand it, because even if you are not right still in the evening we get the right answer, I also encourage you that whenever we get the answers let's go back to ours notes and remind ourselves about the issues we are learning about. I have understood that there is a book which will be put to show the way people respond to cases, so I don't know whether it will be showing the Marks and our performance, so I advise you all to be active. Another thing I am not sure about is whether Qiana receives her phone back but to those who have their phones, please let us use them to share ideas so that we can take this project ahead also to make our representatives happy, I know they were so upset yesterday. I wish you a good day."

Quality assurance	Communication and information	NA	NA	NA	NA	No entry for sixSupervisoryCategory	Facilitator	Preferably try review patients first. There will only be 1 surgeon coming for 1 day on tuesday. We have to prioritise the urgent cases for her to review first eg. People who have been seen and have a problem like a perforation or pus will get priority over those who have a problem like wax or those who have not been seen yet by VHTs

But I suggest before we call anyone else, we should make invitation letters calling the Health workers like the in charge of Seeta Nazigo where we work from, we give them a chance, the Master of Ceremony I suggest we call a person called Dauda, most people call her ""Dembe lya Museveni"" (meaning the peace of Museveni) because she does her things very well, she will not make us stay hungry because most of the MCs make people stay hungry, I suggest we bring up ideas on this issue."

Quality assurance	Supportive environment	Supportive environment	Supportive Environment	NA	NA	No entry for sixSupervisoryCategory	CHW	" I was thinking that Matthew needs to be helped, and informed on where to write his issues, we shall be happy if those around him direct him where to put the messages, that the VHT case group is for learning, let him use the Seeta Nazigo group. It is true he has a problem with his leg and I have ever seen him at the health centre looking for treatment. It doesn't look look when you open messages in VHT case group and you find Matthew talking about himself alone or Gordon doing the same. I have only mentioned the two because am always making jokes with them but even others, let's write in the right groups in order to get good communication. Thank you"

Communication and information	Supportive environment	Supportive environment	Supportive environment	NA	NA	No entry for sixSupervisoryCategory	CHW	" Greetings VHTs, thank you so much for serving the nation, am Nora and this is how I respond to Edward's question, did he ask the patient about that thing, whether the patient was born with it or it came recently, if it was there from birth then it has no problem, so my question is, has it just come or the patient had it? Thank you."

Though we have got some problems these days, I don't know how it is that side, but if it rains people seem to be going to their garden so it is hard to find someone at home. They are always out farming. But even if you just maanged to do 1 visit, drop the form off at the health centre. "

Just a reminder that when you complete forms please do so correctly. Some are missing the hearing information and are blank. We can only then assume you did not test for hearing.
