Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Good morning VHTs. Here is todays question. How can you recommend community members to prevent malaria? Do you have any questions about malaria or this case which you are uncertain of and would like us to answer?
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	NA	NA	CHW	" Greetings fellow VHTs and well done! That child has a pre-auricular sinus. As a VHT, I would advise them to get pain killers and also refer them to specialists. Thank you."

Thanks for all you have sacrificed to treat people. May God bless you. I am sorry for being silent but it's because I lost someone and just came back on Sunday night. I turned off data during the period and forgot to turn it on. I also had malaria, was so down and it's only yesterday that I got some energy to go to Seeta but I am sorry for not replying to the question on Monday and Tuesday. Now this is my answer to today's question. When the mother asks the cause of acute otitis media, I tell her the child's immunity is still very low. I also explain to her that the condition is temporary. Regards to you all and I wish you well as you answer the questions. Catherine, Andrew and Bryan, I am on my way coming. May God bless you."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	CHW	" Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. When I check Enoch and the MUAC tape indicates he is severely malnourished, I advise the mother to take him to the health centre immediately since his condition is critical. The advice I can give the mother regarding the sister is to take good care of her by giving her body building food, energy giving food, drinks, milk and millet porridge since she ain't that badly off. All she needs is proper care. That's what I have to say today."
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - giving information	Communication and information - making a request	NA	NA	CHW	"There is a question I am asking my fellow VHTs. There is a house I have found a child. The boy is 10 years, but he is mentally disturbed. So I need your advice. Can I take the child to Andrew on Monday. I need advice because the child does not talk or hear - he is deaf. I need advice what can I do."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	Facilitator	Thank you Nora. You have answered very well but you have not shown us which ear is normal or abnormal. Another thing you have not ticked the bit where it shows wax. You have also not ticked if they have hearing loss. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings my fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work. It's been awhile since we last communicated but it's because I had gone to visit a patient somewhere. My reply to today's question is, that disease called cholesteatoma is one we can't tamper with. In case I confirm she has it, I immediately refer her to an ENT surgeon. I see her ear doesn't look well. When I look inside it has pus, and a perforation of the ear drum. That patient needs a washout. After washing out I give antibiotics. Then I do follow up. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - clarifying information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - apology	NA	NA	Facilitator	Hi Harriet. Sorry for the delay in replying. Did you find someone to help you film your video? Did you find out if they were malnourished ?  If you need to advise the mother then tell her to go to the health centre for an assessment by wicliffe
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - acknowledgement	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	CHW	"Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and thanks for the work you're doing. How are you our bosses? Thank God for enabling you to serve us. I also thank our interpreters and may God bless them. How are you our supervisors Edward and Dorothy? Thank God who has protected you. Fellow VHTs, I love you in Christ. Now this is my answer to today's question. If the mother of that child asks me what to do, I advise her to buy her pain killers because of the pain and as a form of first aid. Truth is I am not the one supposed to treat that kind of disease so I refer them to ENT specialists for treatment. There is no pus to wash out or a hole so I cannot handle them. That's my answer to today's question."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	"Good morning members. Thanks for the work we have started doing today. That lady Annette, we discovered yesterday she has itching in the ear, so we were told that sometimes itching comes because of some bacteria in the body. But in all situations there is no way that antibiotics are recommended for this. So if they are so hard on me and want antibiotics I refer them to the specialist. Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me. Then I inform her - let those people examine you but if they find a problem in you I will see if you can get medicine but right now I don;t have the medicine for you. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs. I can see a swelling on the pinna. Such conditions become serious if you don't attend to them early. If I see such a patient, I refer them to a specialist because they need surgery and as soon as possible."

The way they are supposed to be, but in the beginning you didn't tell us about washing the hands. All in all it was nice - thanks. "

Sorry I did not answer yesterday I was at a burial so I didn't have time. If I examine the patient and I see they have cholesteatoma I refer the patient as soon as possible. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	CHW	Greetings fellow VHTs.

Supportive environment	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Well done Dorothy this is absolutely correct. Do all other VHTs agree? If you do you don't need to reply to the question as this is the correct answer.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Good morning fellow members. Thanks for today and yesterday's work. We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine."
Supportive environment	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - mutual learning	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	"Thank you Edward, what I can say, the ear with wax needs olive oil and that with pain I think the person needs pain killers and we see how he will be. That is my idea."
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - logistics and planning	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	Hi Andrew. Good morning. I have a patient we were going to see today. He has a hearing loss and a swelling of the pinna and it has a perforation like a sinus on it. So I told them we will meet in town. Another patient does not hear. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	" Greetings fellow health workers. Now this is my answer to today's question. I would first of all advise Enoch's mother  to take that child for immunisation like my fellows have mentioned. The symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, swollen cheeks, pot belly and sometimes swollen arms. Such children tend to be sickly and take long to heal even with treatment. Another symptom is low body weight for their age. Also, they are always sad and do not play with others and they look tired all the time. If you lay them down on their bellies, the skin from their thighs to the buttocks becomes wrinkled. That's how I can tell if Enoch is malnourished."
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	"Hello Dr. Andrew  I have a patient who has a swelling on the ear, but today we are meeting at 2pm so please can we see them together?"
Supportive environment	Communication and information - giving information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	Greetings to you all VHTs. I found a patient called X. The problem she has is that the ear is swollen like you see in the picture and it is painful. She is in so much pain. I would like feedback from Andrew. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Thanks	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for today's work. Thank Andrew, Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. This is my answer to today's question. I can honestly see a hole behind the ear. That hole is in most cases caused by a disease from poor hygiene whereas some are born with it. It's like cholesteatoma. The way the hole is formed is like...I think they call it post auricular. That's how I see it. In such a case, this is how I handle the patient. I encourage them to maintain cleanliness and to visit the health centre earlier before it gets to the bone. Once it gets to the bone it may cause damage to the brain leading to diseases like cancer. That's how I've answered today's question."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - acknowledgement	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	"Ok Francesca, thank you. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	NA	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	"Hi VHTs. Here are some suggestions about how to prevent diahorrea: Breastfeed more frequently when a baby has diarrhoea.

Give more fluids to children with diarrhoea.

Giving oral rehydration salts solution can strengthen a child and reduce the risk of death from diarrhoea.

Prevent diarrhoea by disposing of all faeces in a latrine 

Wash hands with soap before preparing or handling food, before eating or feeding a child. after using the toilet or changing a child who has defecated, before and after taking care of someone who is sick, after touching sick or dead animals

Use safe water for drinking and food preparation

Do not drink water from any source directly without boiling it 

Safe water can be made unsafe if carried in dirty containers or stored in dirty containers or left uncovered in clean containers

Protect water from contamination by covering water storage containers and keeping animals away.

Cook food well and protect it from flies.

Cover stored food.

Use clean eating utensils."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	CHW	Welcome back from the meeting. Thanks for the work. It's me Patricia and this is my reply to today's question. That patient has a hearing loss so I would advise him to go and see ENT specialists for further examination. They would also advise him to get hearing aids to amplify sounds.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings VHTs. We usually give our opinions. What I think of Karl's answer that diarrhoea is caused by eating dirty stuff differs a little from his. Someone who eats dirty things gets typhoid but diarrhoea is caused by other things. One who eats dirty things passes out stool with blood but diarrhoea is caused by a lot of other things like too much heat in the stomach, eating a lot of food stuff and many others. That's what I think. Thank you."

For those who had patients and they got well, we thank God. And for those who are still sick, may God see you through. Now when I look at that photo, the condition is called fungal otitis externa and it's in our books if you read. Regards to you all and I wish you a blessed and peaceful day tomorrow.

Welcome back from the church service. What are we going to do about Miss X? I haven't got a reply yet. I was suggesting we fix some time tomorrow evening and give her some antibiotics because of the wounds so she can get some peace. How do you see?
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - mutual learning	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Catherine told us that the wound takes time to heal since its inside the ear, so you have to explain that to the patient as well such that she can go ahead with the treatment."

Case: On a home visit you see a child, Joyce Nakosi, who is 3 years old.

You take the history from the mother and said says that the child has been tugging at their right ear like they are in pain, but do not have any discharge coming from the right ear. The left ear is ok.

You look in the ear with your otoscope and the ear drum (tympanic membrane) looks like this: "

Thanks for the work you're doing. I can see an ear with a hole in today's photo. People have that hole with no pain at times and from what I see it's not painful. If it was painful the person needs to see doctors. That's my view. The hole is called a sinus.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. The way I see that child, I have no treatment for her condition as a VHT. I am not a qualified health worker therefore can't be permitted to treat her. The advice I can give to the mother is to take the child to a big health centre immediately. I can go ahead and escort her as well because her child's health is in danger at that moment. That's my reply to today's question."
