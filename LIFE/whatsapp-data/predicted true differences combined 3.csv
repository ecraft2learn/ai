Give more fluids to children with diarrhoea.

Giving oral rehydration salts solution can strengthen a child and reduce the risk of death from diarrhoea.

Prevent diarrhoea by disposing of all faeces in a latrine 

Wash hands with soap before preparing or handling food, before eating or feeding a child. after using the toilet or changing a child who has defecated, before and after taking care of someone who is sick, after touching sick or dead animals

Use safe water for drinking and food preparation

Do not drink water from any source directly without boiling it 

Safe water can be made unsafe if carried in dirty containers or stored in dirty containers or left uncovered in clean containers

Protect water from contamination by covering water storage containers and keeping animals away.

Cook food well and protect it from flies.

Cover stored food.

Use clean eating utensils."

Some of our VHTs had made a mistake of mobilizing the people to come on 5th where some were asking for loud speakers to pass through people while informing them like those of Kirijja butooke which is not right.  The right thing is that one you are trying to clarify, because even me I was here today and a certain lady who was in church and she said they were told in church to go to the Health Centre for treatment. I forwarded another one to you who was also having the same information, I told her to come to you for assessment first, and if her problem is worse that's when she will be able to see the Doctor."

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Communication and information - acknowledgement,Supportive environment - encouragement and praise,NA,NA,CHW,"Well done fellows. All you have talked about is right. We go there and find long lines and we don't even get the treatment. The doctors that have studied should be given opportunity to work in health centres. Some doctors are very old and have worked for years me. You go to seek treatment and they refuse to attend to you .Someone feels like they inherited the position and can only leave after death. You hear people have studied but have no jobs but we haven't been helped. I always see from our health centres here forexample seeta Nazigo, you find a very old woman tired of giving birth and cannot even advise the pregnant women or take good care of them. I think they should give chance to the fresh ones. That's my opinion."

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Communication and information - giving opinion,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"There is someone who interuppted me when I was talking, but if the government can help and put money into the health system, things will be possible. They can’t take people to other countries for treatment like China. For example, as you know, most of our doctors who are experts are abroad, meaning they aren't paying them enough money here. Or if not the government doesn't invest in the health sector. We could have ear services if the government cared and gave money to the health center. "
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"Therefore up to now people have that feeling the when you to any Government hospital without money, you won't get treatment so they fear staying in a line and at the end of the day they are not worked upon, but a rich person just goes  once and fast. People end up regretting for example pregnant mothers who go for antinental care and those who take their children for immunization, they say they wish they had money so that they can pay and be worked on fast like in a private health centre. I think it could be so easy if we had that system where we have enough doctors in health centres, this can save time and people will stop thinking of paying for the treatment, that's my view as Luke"

Supportive environment,Communication and information - training,Supportive environment - Greetings,Supportive environment - Religion,Supportive environment - thanks,NA,CHW,Greetings my friends and thanks for the work you're doing. Welcome back from the training though I wasn't with you but I believe we were together. I thank our bosses for the work they're doing. May God bless them. I have also seen today's question and I won't differ so much from my fellows. First of all I encourage the mother not to be afraid because it happens in children because their bodies are weak. What causes the disease is poor nutrition since most children have low appetite. Balancing their diet is also hard yet they need all kinds of food. I also tell the mother to maintain hygiene and not to pour water in their ears. Also they need to find out and treat any other diseases like malaria and cough because they cause acute otitis media. We know pain killers cure the disease in two days if there's no other disease. May God be with you. Good night.
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Supportive environment - Greetings,Supportive environment - thanks,NA,NA,CHW,"Greetings fellow VHTs , our bosses and well done. This is my reply to the question of the three year old child with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea refers to passing out abnormal stool. Much as someone is supposed to pass out stool that is soft and not so hard, this one is way soft. It is actually watery and we call it ""mbiro"". That's my definition for diarrhoea. The people in my community call it ""mbiro""( running stomach) while others call it ""kidumusi"". I think it is caused by eating dirty things like uncovered food contaminated by houseflies or cockroaches, eating feaces, not washing hands after visiting the toilet or after touching dirty things before eating especially children. Children eat whatever they find and it doesn't matter if they have just been to the toilet or from playing. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea. I advise the person to go to the health centre  for examination since malaria can also cause it. I also advise them to take ORS and other drinks like passion fruit juice. If they can't afford it, they can make it themselves by mixing two spoonfuls of sugar in a pinch of salt and they need to take it frequently. The spoon for measurements should be very small. Thank you."

I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. As Luke, I let Annette know that I won't give her antibiotics because they could damage her ears. I advise her to keep them clean and to also get checked for any skin infections. That's how I explain to her. May be the issue of age too but we were told it's usually 60years and above not 50. I ensure she's satisfied with my explanation about the antibiotic drops being dangerous to her ears that seem normal before I leave her home. All white medicines have effects including panadol which may damage your liver if taken in over dose. On that note I ask her to be patient and visit the health centre for examination of any skin infections. Thank you so much."

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"As Harriet, I think children from poor communities are prone to diseases because some people don't take certain issues seriously. They know even if they find out about them, there's nothing much they can do. If at all they fail to get salt and eat food without salt! That's why some get knives and commit suicide. Therefore, if something is not preventing one from eating or drinking, it's not an issue. That's why poor children are affected because of need."

Well done! This is my answer to the question. The symptoms I can consider when assessing a child that looks malnourished like Enoch include the following. First of all they look sad and irritated. One can easily tell their bodies lack water, blood, fats, salt and calcium. Such children have very pale skin, swollen bellies, swollen cheeks, sunken eyes, thin hair and swollen legs. They also feel thirsty all the time since their bodies lack many nutrients. They feel weak and pain when one touches them. That's what I have to say."

Then after the 5 days I wash out with 9mls of H20 and 1 ml of iodine. I then dry mop those ears. If I do all that and the wax remains I put oil in the ears again and then wash out again after 5 days. If it remains again I refer the patient to a specialist. But the advice I give to that patient is not to insert sticks in to their ears - becuase this can affect the ear canal and ear drum. I also tell them that incase they get problems with their ears they should not self medicate. But they should see a health worker. "

I wasn't around because I had gone for burial at Ssi but this is my answer to the question. The symptoms of malaria include vomiting and high temperature.

I write down my names, head of household who signed the consent form and the names of the patient, their village plus everything concerning their ears. For example they told me they feel some pain, so I ask how long they've had it. After that, I ask them if they have any other disease besides ears. When I'm done with that, I embark on examination for the second time since I would have finished the wash out and given them some pain killers. I then check their hearing using the whispered voice hearing test. After that I give them a copy of the form to confirm that I have successfully treated them and then I take the pink one to the health centre.

I request that at least if we had donors who can fund the health sector that would help us and have ENT specialists who are more than the number that we have. Because we can take an example of South Africa, they have 240 ENT doctors... we need the same. In South Africa people have more power than us. We can do the smae as we are many "

I then advise her to get rid of cockroaches and houseflies in the latrines by spraying. I ask her to keep covering her latrine , avoid rearing animals close to the home, not to give children half cooked meat and ensuring children wash their hands after going to the latrine. She must also wash her hands with soap before preparing food for the children, boil drinking water and one used to prepare food. That's my answer to today's question."

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"Fellow VHTs, this is my reply to today's questions. 4a) What prevents patients from going to Mulago is because the president said it's no longer free of charge. They will continue using it to treat only very complicated diseases and someone has to pay some money. The amount I heard him mention was too high to be affordable by common man. Another issue is some people don't know where it's located and the queue is always long. Doctors always want some money which we may refer to as bribe. 4b)In 2009, we had few doctors because all doctors who have gone to school end up going abroad (brain drain). It is an important issue that is caused by low salary. 4c) Those doctors should be coming to health centres grade II, III and IV. They should give out their phone numbers. That's my reply to the questions. I remain Byamukama Gordon."

My phone was showing the word no service in place of the company name MTN. After switching it off is when I received the question but all along I thought it was a general problem from the company. I have seen the question very late. Forgive me. In the picture it's like there's a child but an older one who was born with something like a hole on the pinna. I usually see them on people but they hardly have any problems with them like pain. If I find someone like that having a problem with it, I don't give them any other advice but refer them to any ENT specialist for further advice or even treatment. But from what I know they hardly cause any pain unless the one bearing it experiences some changes otherwise they never have any problems. It's congenital so I advise the person to go and see ENT specialists. That's how I can handle it. I remain VHT Gordon at Makata. Thank you so much though I've replied late. I am sorry."
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Communication and information - requesting information,Supportive Environment - thanks,NA,NA,CHW,"Thank you so much Andrew for the information you shared yesterday, what I would like to learn more about, you may find a person with too much pus in the ear, even if you washout the ear, the pus doesn't stop or reduce, my question is, is there somewhere that the pus hides in the ear drum? And if yes, doesn't it affect someone when the pus hides somewhere in the ear? Can't the pus go through the mouth and accidentally someone eats it and gets another problem? Am still wondering about this and it confuses me whereby I need to learn more, and lastly the holes in the ear drum, how are they caused?"
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"This problem is there in Uganda (4B), because someone can care about his child and pay for school fees, the child goes to school. After studies the child can't find jobs and those people who are doing those jobs are so old. The parent sees they have lost money on the child. They think of another option - so they tell the child to go abroad to look for jobs. Those people abroad have more opportunities that here in Uganda. That is why they go abroad. So here we don't have experts. Another problem and cause, though our doctors work hard - they get little pay. They know the money is not enough. Even getting that money some of them don;t get it on time. They worked for their money, but the administrators take months and months. They stay in self contained rooms which are costly, the need to buy food, pay bills. All this is hard if you don't get paid promptly. These are big sacrifices for them to make. If the conditions are so hard why can't such a doctor just go abroad where they are paid well. "

Supportive environment,Communication and information - clarifying information,Communication and information - giving information,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,"Karl asked ""Why is it that someone can get bitten by a mosquito and not suffer from malaria yet another one may? Also why do children under 5, pregnant women and those from western Uganda prone to malaria compared to other people? Karl. To answer your questions, some mosqitoes carry malaria Karl, others do not. Therefore one person might be bitten by a mosquito like the female anonphales which carries malaria, and the other person may be bitten by a male mosquito which does not carry it. Those in western Uganda have higher rates of malaria as the number of mosquitoes there are higher. Pregnant women and children have weakend immune systems compared to adults so are more likely to get malaria. Qiana asked  My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? Qiana, thank you. To answer your question: Although they might be sleeping under a net with no holes, they could have been bitten at any other point before they fall asleep. For example at dusk when they are collecting water. It only takes one bite to get malaria. Francesca asked My question is why does fatigue cause malaria? Francesca, malaria causes fatigue as you get fevers, get dehydrated from sweating and the body feels weak. Also it can damage the red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. Isabella asked ""They train them to do blood check ups for malaria. Is it possible with us too?"" Isabella - thank you for your enthusiasm. Right now we are not able to provide RDTs and medicine for malaria to the VHTs, since we only have a small amount of money. We think though that now you are aware that if a person presents to you with the symptoms of malaria you will know to advise them to get an RDT, check for malaria and refer them to the health centre to seek treatment if they require it. This is something you should ask the supervisors of Omni Med since they are the ones who are responsible for other disease except the ear. "

It's true the child's father is around but is no better than the mum. The other relative is the paternal grandfather but he is 100+ years. I think much as the parents are not mentally okay, they have done something because the child looks better than she was when they had just brought her. I suggest if the child is given treatment, us VHTs don't stay very far from them and can check on them once in awhile. The mother told me the problem is she doesn't take milk and only takes porridge after being forced. The other food she tries to eat is rice and posho. Also, she can hardly afford it but if she gets it, she's able to feed her. She's also capable of looking after her child since she's not that badly off mentally. I suggest if the child gets treatment, we can check on her every now and then to show her how to give it to her. That's my opinion."

When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar 
•	They are ill e.g. they have HIV
•	They do not have access to enough food 
•	They are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months
•	Not receiving routine vaccines
•	Lack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein "

After accepting, I give her pain killers. When she says the pain has reduced, I do the ear wash out to remove the discharge. Next I dry it like I said in the first place. Another question, what important questions I'm I supposed to ask her. They include, how long she has had the pain, if she has had any treatment before and then I examine. After examining, I ask if she has any allergy. If she says she has, I call my bosses to inquire from them what to do like they told us."
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Supportive environment - Greetings,Supportive environment - thanks,NA,NA,CHW,"Greetings to you all and this is my reply to the question.
A. The biggest cause of hearing loss in Mukono district is sickness which affects their bodies. Medication causes the problem too. Inserting sticks in their ears to remove wax and stone quarries also cause hearing loss. B. Yes, people are discouraged when there are no hearing aids or if they're unable to afford them. C. As VHTs, what we can do is to advise people on how to prevent ear problems that can cause hearing loss. I also call upon the government to offer free treatment for people with hearing loss or to reduce on the tax of hearing aids during their importation to Uganda so they are affordable. They should also deploy more ENT specialists in government health centres. That's my reply to today's questions. Thanks so much."
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Supportive environment - Thanks,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator," Thanks Jane. Otitis media is a disease of poor hygiene and actually much more common in poor children than those from rich families. For example, in poor areas of Australia almost 70% of children has CSOM compared to the rich areas where it is only 1%. It is a disease of inequality.  It is common in areas of overcrowding, poor hygiene etc. If a child is exposed to a dirty environment and put things in their ears then they have more risk of introducing bacteria..."

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Supportive environment - Greetings,NA,NA,NA,CHW," Greetings fellow VHTs. Today's question requires us to state what we can tell our community members to do so as to prevent malaria. First of all, we should advise them to sleep under treated mosquito nets. Secondly we should ask them to put screen nets in the ventilators of their houses to prevent mosquitoes from entering them. Thirdly they should close their windows and doors as soon as it clocks 7pm. Fourthly they shouldn't have bushes around their houses. Mosquitoes can hide in those bushes and bite them thus causing malaria. They should also avoid stagnant water around their houses to prevent their breeding. Those are the five ways I can advise people to prevent malaria."
Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,So after someone has malaria they have a weakend body. Even after the parasite clears they will feel weak for a few days.

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,"Acute Otitis Media (AOM) WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH CHRONIC SUPPRATIVE OTITIS MEDIA WHICH IS WHERE PUS IS PRESENT is just where there is a red, painful ear drum, but no perforation, no pus. It is not dangerous and usually settles with simple pain relief. It is most common in young children under 5, but can happen to anyone at any age. It is usually caused by a simple virus, and therefore does not need antibiotics. Remember antibiotics are only effective against BACTERIA, NOT VIRUSES.

I suggest VHTs within that area should explain to both the grandparent and father the situation at hand. They should tell them the child is malnourished and was referred to the health centre so that they also get involved. If they don't get involved, then a good samaritan will have to accompany them and stay with them in case they are admitted.

Sometimes the person is born with it, other times they develop it over time. Noone knows the exact cause. What is important to know is that people can be allergic to lots of different things e.g. fur, dust, antibiotics, pollen, nuts, milk etc. The response also differs. For example some people have a minor reaction e.g. itching. Others have a very severe and dangerous reaction. Their lips swell up and their airway can close off.

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,"This is my reply to the question. Mr. Jamil might been affected as a result of the kind of treatment and care given to people. To be honest, quinine has damaged many people's ears. One uses it without taking enough drinks. Remember these are children and we have to take responsible for their wellbeing. Now, he might have been given quinine by the parents without water. He might also have been sickly as a child and the parents kept giving him quinine tablets. We know quinine tablets cause hearing loss. Secondly, the condition might have started while in the womb. The mother might have been alcoholic, had low immunity or wasn't eating certain nutrients when pregnant which help in the proper formation of the bones of hearing. It might also have been as a result of tough parents who slap their children causing the ear drum to burst. That's what I think. In Seeta there's a 14 year old kid who has a problem with hearing and the mother says quinine is the cause."

Sorry if my voice is so low but that's the loudest it can get because I fell sick. I explain to him the causes of hearing loss which include the  following. One can lose hearing while in their mother's womb. In case a pregnant woman falls sick and doesn't get treatment, for example from severe malaria, it affects the baby's brain. Some pregnant women use strong medicine for treatment. Others use alcoholic stuff, drugs like marijuana which affects the baby's brain causing hearing loss. Some people use head sets with loud sound which leads to bursting of the ear drum. Accidents also cause hearing loss for instance when one falls and the ears are affected. May be diseases from old age too and the treatment given thereafter like quinine. That's my reply."

Another thing I advise her is not to keep animals around the house because Catherine told us that isn't good. Make sure you cook meat well. Also I teach her to tell the kids to wash their hands after they eat and the mum with soap even when preparing the food for the kids. Also giving them boiled water.

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,Communication and information - giving information,NA,NA,NA,CHW,This is my reply to today's question. I didn't have OTT yesterday. The question is about what causes malaria and this is my answer. Most people have mentioned not sleeping under a mosquito net for malaria so I'll leave it at that. Let me talk about typhoid. Typhoid affects the intestines and most of the time it is not diagnosed with a blood check up. They usually use waste. It is caused by eating dirty things over and over for a long period of time. This could be through touching soil while digging that may have been contaminated by feaces and after eat a jack fruit or you could be having worms. Normally we all have malaria in our bodies but it only comes out if we let the worms in our bodies multiply like it is the case for T.B and measles. That's my answer for today's question.

RDT is only used to check malaria. The microscope shows a lot including typhoid. You very well know here at Seeta Nazigo before they introduced RDT, the microscope couldn't detect malaria even when someone felt so much pain. Typhoid can hardly be seen in dispensary or government health centres. It's commonly detected in clinics."

Quality assurance,Communication and information - training,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,Hi vhts so the correct answer is that this is an infected preauricular sinus.
