Supportive environment	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - acknowledgement	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.

For that patient who has wax I explain to them that you have wax and I am going to do a washout and then she will have our medicine of olive oil. I give her the olive oil and show her how to apply it for the first time. Then I tell her to be doing it three times a day for five days. After doing that I ask her to come back to do a washout out. If she has been doing it properly we go ahead and do that washout and dry mopping. "

Actually the person can hardly stand and appears like they are dizzy. Secondly, the child has sunken eyes. Others include dry skin, low appetite, heavy eyes and can neither lift their legs nor handle anything with their hands due to body weakness. Those are some of the symptoms."

After finding out Enoch is malnourished, this is the advice I can give to the mother. I would advise her to give enough food to the children so that their bodies are strong enough to resist diseases. Secondly, I would advise her to always breast feed her children in case she gives birth to any for at least 1year and 6 months. I would also ask her to ensure all children are immunised and to follow any other advice from the doctors. That's what I can tell Enoch's mother to prevent malnutrition in other children."

We shouldn't deal with just the mum because she has mental issues. I know the child has a father though he's also not okay and a grandparent called Baraza. I suggest VHTs within that area should explain to both the grandparent and father the situation at hand. They should tell them the child is malnourished and was referred to the health centre so that they also get involved. If they don't get involved, then a good samaritan will have to accompany them and stay with them in case they are admitted.

Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	"Good morning members. Thanks for yesterday's work and that of today. Today's question requires us to give the causes of hearing loss. Personally, I will give you 4 or 5 causes. First of all, Mr. Jamil is 37 years but has had the problem since childhood which implies he must have suffered from severe malaria leading to that problem. Another cause is some medication like quinine. Formation of a baby in the womb is another one.  There are cases where some body parts are not fully developed and in this particular case it could be the ears. Also, the bone responsible for hearing could be having a hole leading to hearing loss. Fifth cause is Jamil might have been exposed to different sounds like loud places, loud music and welding workshops. That's my opinion."

Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"My third question - after seeing that the equipment is expensive I encourage them and advise them that there are technical schools, where they can go and learn. Because even the teachers who teach them use sign language. So that way they can develop themselves instead of staying the same when they don't know anything. Yet in those technical schools some do craft work, weaving baskets. They also teach them as people who hear. They also have a chance and an opportunity because those people train in construction, carpentry sand many more. They can be trained in sign language - a bit like the blind with braille.Because the blind can't see but they have special equipment. So the same applies to the deaf. There are many things they can use to help them. Though they can't hear they can see what can be done. So they can see each sign they are taught. "

If I examine and find discharge in her left ear, I wash, dry it and then put antibiotic drops for about one week. b) I take the history on the form with three copies. One remains in the book, another is taken to the health centre while the other is given to the patient. c)The important questions I ask the patient as I take their history include her name, age, the ear with a problem , if her hearing is okay, if she has tinnitus, discharge, itching, pain or if they have any problem besides ears.

Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Communication and information - giving information	NA	NA	NA	CHW	This is my reply to today's question. I didn't have OTT yesterday. The question is about what causes malaria and this is my answer. Most people have mentioned not sleeping under a mosquito net for malaria so I'll leave it at that. Let me talk about typhoid. Typhoid affects the intestines and most of the time it is not diagnosed with a blood check up. They usually use waste. It is caused by eating dirty things over and over for a long period of time. This could be through touching soil while digging that may have been contaminated by feaces and after eat a jack fruit or you could be having worms. Normally we all have malaria in our bodies but it only comes out if we let the worms in our bodies multiply like it is the case for T.B and measles. That's my answer for today's question.

Welcome back from the training though I wasn't with you but I believe we were together. I thank our bosses for the work they're doing. May God bless them. I have also seen today's question and I won't differ so much from my fellows. First of all I encourage the mother not to be afraid because it happens in children because their bodies are weak. What causes the disease is poor nutrition since most children have low appetite. Balancing their diet is also hard yet they need all kinds of food. I also tell the mother to maintain hygiene and not to pour water in their ears. Also they need to find out and treat any other diseases like malaria and cough because they cause acute otitis media. We know pain killers cure the disease in two days if there's no other disease. May God be with you. Good night.
Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Communication and information - giving information	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"I am sorry my network was bad. People in my community understand diarrhoea from the stool that is passed out which is usually watery. It is also passed out more times than the usual and like I told you, a normal person is supposed to defecate three or four times a day but for diarrhoea it could be seven. When I see such a child as a VHT, the first aid I can give to her is Oral Rehydration Salt which is a mixture of sugar and salt then refer her to the health centre if the diarrhoea is severe. At the health centre they can give her zinc for children and ORS tablets that are swallowed; one tablet once a day for ten days. That's what I think."

I am sorry I didn't answer yesterday's question because my phone was dead. Thanks to those who replied. Now for today's question I am being asked what I can see in the picture. I see an ear that has a hole behind the pinna and we were told that hole is called post auricular fistula. What I can do for a patient with that condition is to refer them to specialists. I personally don't have the treatment for such an ear. That's how I've answered that question.

Just like my fellows, diarrhoea at home can be prevented by mothers encouraging their children to wash their hands before eating anything and after visiting the latrine. They should also avoid eating dirty things like unwashed mangoes, defecate in latrines and not anywhere else, drink boiled water and also cover food to prevent it from contamination by cockroaches."

Thanks for the work we have started doing today. That lady Annette, we discovered yesterday she has itching in the ear, so we were told that sometimes itching comes because of some bacteria in the body. But in all situations there is no way that antibiotics are recommended for this. So if they are so hard on me and want antibiotics I refer them to the specialist. Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me. Then I inform her - let those people examine you but if they find a problem in you I will see if you can get medicine but right now I don;t have the medicine for you. "

Sorry for taking long to reply to the question I took a long time to reach home. If I find wax in the ears of the patient, I give them olive oil to apply - three drops, two times. For five days.

So the advice I can give her is to at least use these tissues we use for washout. "

Otitis media is a disease of poor hygiene and actually much more common in poor children than those from rich families.

Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	Communication and information - requesting information	Supportive environment - apology	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	CHW	"This is my answer to the question fellow health workers. It doesn't differ so much from what my fellows said. We can prevent malaria by sleeping under treated mosquito nets, clearing bushes around us, cleaning our compounds and ensuring there are no holes to retain water, burning any tins like the ones of vaseline and bottles since they also retain water where mosquitoes can breed from. That's how I can advise the people in my community. My question is, people in our areas ask us that since we advise them to sleep under mosquito nets and the government gives them those nets free of charge, can't they also give them the medicine used to treat them? Some of them are low income earners so after washing them they cannot afford it. That's my question. Have a good Sunday and regards to you. I apologize for being the last one to answer the question.

Question 2) I take her history but before that, I give her the consent form to confirm that she has accepted the treatment I will be giving her. I explain to her why she has to sign it. After accepting, I give her pain killers. When she says the pain has reduced, I do the ear wash out to remove the discharge. Next I dry it like I said in the first place. Another question, what important questions I'm I supposed to ask her. They include, how long she has had the pain, if she has had any treatment before and then I examine. After examining, I ask if she has any allergy. If she says she has, I call my bosses to inquire from them what to do like they told us."

Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"This is my reply to the question. Mr. Jamil might been affected as a result of the kind of treatment and care given to people. To be honest, quinine has damaged many people's ears. One uses it without taking enough drinks. Remember these are children and we have to take responsible for their wellbeing. Now, he might have been given quinine by the parents without water. He might also have been sickly as a child and the parents kept giving him quinine tablets. We know quinine tablets cause hearing loss. Secondly, the condition might have started while in the womb. The mother might have been alcoholic, had low immunity or wasn't eating certain nutrients when pregnant which help in the proper formation of the bones of hearing. It might also have been as a result of tough parents who slap their children causing the ear drum to burst. That's what I think. In Seeta there's a 14 year old kid who has a problem with hearing and the mother says quinine is the cause."

Sorry I was unable to answer yesterday's question because my phone battery was dead. This is my reply to the causes of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono. Most of the time people get ear infections with no where to go for treatment so they resort to using herbal medicine. Someone spends 30 years with no treatment because they have no idea where to find the ENT specialists. B. Yes, people get discouraged because they haven't received any treatment and have no money to buy hearing aids. C. What I can do for such people is to counsel them and let them know they ain't alone."

Today's question is still about Enoch. The symptoms of malnutrition include   first of all, a swollen body. As a VHT I can use my finger to press the swollen part and if it leaves a hole, it means the child is malnourished. Another method I can use is that of the tape called MUAC which stands for Mid Upper Arm Circumference and it has three colors yellow, green and red. If I use that tape and it shows yellow, it means the child is not that badly off but if it indicates red then they are malnourished and need to be fed to get better. That's how I can tell.

What I can do for deaf people as a VHT include the following. First of all those people need to be shown love. Someone like me who is able to hear needs to do the few signs I know happily, show them that I care and love them and that I am not special because they need company. I can also teach these people things they do not know like how to keep their ears clean and free from infections much as they are deaf. I also teach them spiritual things. God created people and all is possible before Him. He used to heal the blind, deaf and lame people. I can therefore advise them to go and see pastors who are not fake. There are those who have believed with faith and got their hearing back after prayers. That's how I've answered those questions. May God bless you.

Incase specialists come and I have people with hearing loss in my community, as a VHT I would come together with my fellows and ensure we counsel them. We can come up with a health camp like the one we had at seeta Nazigo health centre III and bring them together. Others may be having their relatives with jobs and money so they can be helped. That's my only suggestion. Counselling them because we don't have money to give them neither are we ENT specialists. Only thing we can do is advising them and counselling them whenever that camp is conducted. Those who can access help, well and good but those who are not able to can be helped that way.

They have sent us those videos above and asked us to watch them, especially the last one then we say what we think of them. These are the notes I have taken. Washing hands is really important for the person mixing the solution and the care taker. It is also important to note that the packet of ORS is poured in one litre of water. The people in the rural areas should be told one litre equals four cups and the water has to be safe. One may see water that appears clean and think it's safe yet it's not boiled therefore we should tell people safe water means boiled water that has been stored well. We should also keep teaching care takers how to give ORS and to ensure all the things used to mix and store it are clean. Since we have discovered that it is common among children, parents must know the number of times to give the ORS and the time to do it. The parent must also know that the things used to mix the solution should be used for one day. She must cover it if not giving it to the child and also keep it in a clean place so as not to get contaminated. Thank you so much."

Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW	" 4a) The reason as to why people don't go to health centres is not because of long queues but it's because of the few health workers. You see even us when we go out in the community to treat ears, you can work on three people and feel fatigued already. Those health workers get tired, and that's why they're unable to work on some patients. Others ask for bribe. Another issue is, when ears just have discharge some people don't feel pain. In Uganda when someone doesn't feel pain it's hard for them to go to the doctor. That's my point. Also, our government doesn't mind much about health issues. It only cares about security issues.

Thank Andrew, Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. This is my answer to today's question. I can honestly see a hole behind the ear. That hole is in most cases caused by a disease from poor hygiene whereas some are born with it. It's like cholesteatoma. The way the hole is formed is like...I think they call it post auricular. That's how I see it. In such a case, this is how I handle the patient. I encourage them to maintain cleanliness and to visit the health centre earlier before it gets to the bone. Once it gets to the bone it may cause damage to the brain leading to diseases like cancer. That's how I've answered today's question."
Quality assurance	Communication and information - training	NA	NA	NA	NA	CHW	This is my answer to question 2. I think the reason as to why our children contract otitis media is because some parents are not hygienic. Some parents don't care. They fail to buy soap therefore the children go to bed without bathing. Sometimes they ask them to do it themselves. This is a 4year old who won't care about cleaning the ears.

Thanks for all the work you're doing. Today I want to talk to you about the issue of the files. I would like us to work together whether one received a file or not. The reason I am saying that is because some people received files with people they didn't treat or who don't stay in their areas. If someone sends a name of a person from their file that they didn't treat or who don't stay in their area, the one who knows them should help and direct that person. Today someone else may be having a file but next time it will be you. I suggest we work together to make this work easy because it's 30th and almost June. It will be bad if we look for those people without finding them yet someone who could be knowing them just didn't let us know. An example is yesterday when Herbert asked who knew the patients he listed down. I am not sure if you sent him a private message because I haven't seen anyone directing him. I therefore suggest we work together so we can finish the work that was given to us. This is not about only those who got the file but everyone. I will be happy if we help each other and do this work very fast.anonymisedMessageWithPseudonymReplacementsGood morning ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for all the work you're doing.

When I look at that patient, I see a pre-auricular sinus that may need surgery. I give the patient panadol for pain relief and then refer them to ENT specialists for treatment. I can also see the pinna itself and the tragus are  swollen. That's my answer to today's question."

What I can tell the mother is to feed that child with a balanced diet for example beans, soya, eggs if possible and others. Truth is children don't have white blood cells that fight against diseases. I explain that to the mother as well. And also ask her to cover their ears while bathing. That's my answer."
