Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Good morning VHTs. Here is todays question. How can you recommend community members to prevent malaria? Do you have any questions about malaria or this case which you are uncertain of and would like us to answer?
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	NA	NA	CHW	" Greetings fellow VHTs and well done! That child has a pre-auricular sinus. As a VHT, I would advise them to get pain killers and also refer them to specialists. Thank you."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - apology	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - thanks	Supportive environment - religion	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for all the work you're doing for the country. Thanks for all you have sacrificed to treat people. May God bless you. I am sorry for being silent but it's because I lost someone and just came back on Sunday night. I turned off data during the period and forgot to turn it on. I also had malaria, was so down and it's only yesterday that I got some energy to go to Seeta but I am sorry for not replying to the question on Monday and Tuesday. Now this is my answer to today's question. When the mother asks the cause of acute otitis media, I tell her the child's immunity is still very low. I also explain to her that the condition is temporary. Regards to you all and I wish you well as you answer the questions. Catherine, Andrew and Bryan, I am on my way coming. May God bless you."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	Facilitator	Thank you Nora. You have answered very well but you have not shown us which ear is normal or abnormal. Another thing you have not ticked the bit where it shows wax. You have also not ticked if they have hearing loss. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings my fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work. It's been awhile since we last communicated but it's because I had gone to visit a patient somewhere. My reply to today's question is, that disease called cholesteatoma is one we can't tamper with. In case I confirm she has it, I immediately refer her to an ENT surgeon. I see her ear doesn't look well. When I look inside it has pus, and a perforation of the ear drum. That patient needs a washout. After washing out I give antibiotics. Then I do follow up. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	" Greetings to you all VHTs. All the symptoms show she is dehydrated therefore I give her first aid of ORS. I can mix the ORS and give it to Patricia's mother. I then advise her to give it to Patricia as she takes her to the health centre. When she gets to the health centre, I may have written the referral form for the nurses to see what the problem is. If not, I escort them and explain it to the nurses so they can put the child on drip immediately."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - clarifying information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - apology	NA	NA	Facilitator	Hi Harriet. Sorry for the delay in replying. Did you find someone to help you film your video? Did you find out if they were malnourished ?  If you need to advise the mother then tell her to go to the health centre for an assessment by wicliffe
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - acknowledgement	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to invovlve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	CHW	"Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and thanks for the work you're doing. How are you our bosses? Thank God for enabling you to serve us. I also thank our interpreters and may God bless them. How are you our supervisors Edward and Dorothy? Thank God who has protected you. Fellow VHTs, I love you in Christ. Now this is my answer to today's question. If the mother of that child asks me what to do, I advise her to buy her pain killers because of the pain and as a form of first aid. Truth is I am not the one supposed to treat that kind of disease so I refer them to ENT specialists for treatment. There is no pus to wash out or a hole so I cannot handle them. That's my answer to today's question."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	"Good morning members. Thanks for the work we have started doing today. That lady Annette, we discovered yesterday she has itching in the ear, so we were told that sometimes itching comes because of some bacteria in the body. But in all situations there is no way that antibiotics are recommended for this. So if they are so hard on me and want antibiotics I refer them to the specialist. Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me. Then I inform her - let those people examine you but if they find a problem in you I will see if you can get medicine but right now I don;t have the medicine for you. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - encouragement and praise	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	Facilitator	"Thank you very much Harriet for sharing that video - all of the points you made very well. The way they are supposed to be, but in the beginning you didn't tell us about washing the hands. All in all it was nice - thanks. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - clarifying information	Supportive environment - greetings	Supportive environment - Religion	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs. Thank God who has enabled us to wake up alive. This is my answer to today's question. If they come to me after getting checked and confirming they have malaria, I give them coartem three tablets in the morning then more three after 12 hours. That is done for three days. In those three days I accompany those tablets with one panadol twice a day because malaria causes pain in the body and headache. Panadol therefore acts as a pain killer that relieves pain in this case but coartem is the real medication for malaria. I also advise them to take a lot of drinks like passion juice, ORS and others. Some think drinks refer to alcohol so they go to bars and buy it claiming the doctor told them to do so and buy alcohol for themselves! They have to be soft drinks so clariy this for those drunk fathers!"

Bryan, Catherine, Hannah. Greetings to you all. Thanks for the questions. I apologise for not replying to the question yesterday. I was so busy. But this is my reply to todays question. For that patient who has wax I explain to them that you have wax and I am going to do a washout and then she will have our medicine of olive oil. I give her the olive oil and show her how to apply it for the first time. Then I tell her to be doing it three times a day for five days. After doing that I ask her to come back to do a washout out. If she has been doing it properly we go ahead and do that washout and dry mopping. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - giving information	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - greetings	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	CHW	Greetings fellow VHTs. Please continue praying for me. You know the illness of my leg is not so easy. I can't rush and complete my work. Thanks for praying for me. God might heal me.

Great video. All of the steps you did were correct. Fantastic. Please feel free to show these videos or share them with other community members on your home visits. They are great.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	"Thanks VHTs - the correct answer is that because Enochs measurement using the tape showed 'Red' you should refer him urgently to the health centre for thorough assessment. Similarly, for his sister; Refer. Any child with swollen feet on both sides should be referred to the health centre. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Good morning fellow members. Thanks for today and yesterday's work. We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine."
Supportive environment	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - mutual learning	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	"Thank you Edward, what I can say, the ear with wax needs olive oil and that with pain I think the person needs pain killers and we see how he will be. That is my idea."
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Communication and information - logistics and planning	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	Hi Andrew. Good morning. I have a patient we were going to see today. He has a hearing loss and a swelling of the pinna and it has a perforation like a sinus on it. So I told them we will meet in town. Another patient does not hear. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	" Greetings fellow health workers. Now this is my answer to today's question. I would first of all advise Enoch's mother  to take that child for immunisation like my fellows have mentioned. The symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, swollen cheeks, pot belly and sometimes swollen arms. Such children tend to be sickly and take long to heal even with treatment. Another symptom is low body weight for their age. Also, they are always sad and do not play with others and they look tired all the time. If you lay them down on their bellies, the skin from their thighs to the buttocks becomes wrinkled. That's how I can tell if Enoch is malnourished."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - giving information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	NA	CHW	Greetings to you all VHTs. I found a patient called X. The problem she has is that the ear is swollen like you see in the picture and it is painful. She is in so much pain. I would like feedback from Andrew. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Thanks	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - greetings	NA	CHW	"Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for today's work. Thank Andrew, Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. This is my answer to today's question. I can honestly see a hole behind the ear. That hole is in most cases caused by a disease from poor hygiene whereas some are born with it. It's like cholesteatoma. The way the hole is formed is like...I think they call it post auricular. That's how I see it. In such a case, this is how I handle the patient. I encourage them to maintain cleanliness and to visit the health centre earlier before it gets to the bone. Once it gets to the bone it may cause damage to the brain leading to diseases like cancer. That's how I've answered today's question."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - acknowledgement	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	"Ok Francesca, thank you. "
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	 Good morning VHTs. What are the causes of hearing loss??
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings VHTs. We usually give our opinions. What I think of Karl's answer that diarrhoea is caused by eating dirty stuff differs a little from his. Someone who eats dirty things gets typhoid but diarrhoea is caused by other things. One who eats dirty things passes out stool with blood but diarrhoea is caused by a lot of other things like too much heat in the stomach, eating a lot of food stuff and many others. That's what I think. Thank you."

For those who had patients and they got well, we thank God. And for those who are still sick, may God see you through. Now when I look at that photo, the condition is called fungal otitis externa and it's in our books if you read. Regards to you all and I wish you a blessed and peaceful day tomorrow. May God enable us to wake up alive. Good bye."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	NA	Facilitator	Thanks all those who replied to todays question - the question was what treatment do you give Patricia. What you can do in that situation is give ORS - ORS is a solution of sugar and salt. And they also need zinc tablets. After that you have to refer Patricia to the health centre for more treatment. Thank you so much. 
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings ladies and gentlemen. Thanks Catherine for the work you're doing. For today's picture this is my reply. Most times people are born with that hole because my child has it too on both ears but it has no problem. But incase I find someone with it and with discharge or itching, I advise them to buy antibiotic tablets in order to ease the pain. That hole is called pre auricular sinus. Many people have it but it has no problem. That's what I have to say about today's photo."

Welcome back from the church service. What are we going to do about Miss X? I haven't got a reply yet. I was suggesting we fix some time tomorrow evening and give her some antibiotics because of the wounds so she can get some peace. How do you see?
Communication and information	Quality assurance - patient management	Supportive environment - mutual learning	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Catherine told us that the wound takes time to heal since its inside the ear, so you have to explain that to the patient as well such that she can go ahead with the treatment."

Case: On a home visit you see a child, Joyce Nakosi, who is 3 years old. The mother says that for the past two days the child has been crying, feverish, irritable and has a respiratory tract infection. They have been coughing a lot and sleeping poorly. You take the history from the mother and said says that the child has been tugging at their right ear like they are in pain, but do not have any discharge coming from the right ear. The left ear is ok.

You look in the ear with your otoscope and the ear drum (tympanic membrane) looks like this: "

She is 80 yo lady, I gave her ear drops which she has been using. Today is the 5th day. I have washed the ear, but I have seen the wax is near the canal. It is so hard you can see it without putting the otoscope, so even if you put tissue papers they can't go in. I request for one of our helpers to come help me. "

I am sorry I haven't been online but God who is above all has enabled me to be on now. I would like to thank Andrew for adding me back. About the child, I can tell they have malaria even after the mother explaining to me their symptoms by referring them to a big health centre for further examination. There are about two types of malaria I can think of. It could be the one transmitted by mosquitoes or typhoid. If it is malaria, I request for the results from the health centre for confirmation. I know at seeta nazigo health centre they treat it. As long as the patient comes suspecting it could be malaria, I just refer them for blood check up. I also advise them to avoid the following. Tall grass around the house, stagnant water and have to ensure the child sleeps under a treated mosquito net. If it's typhoid, I still refer them and advise them to boil drinking water, use clean utensils and cover their food. Have a good day."

Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	Peer supervisor	Good morning fellows wherever you're. Thanks for the work you're doing. I can see an ear with a hole in today's photo. People have that hole with no pain at times and from what I see it's not painful. If it was painful the person needs to see doctors. That's my view. The hole is called a sinus.
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. The way I see that child, I have no treatment for her condition as a VHT. I am not a qualified health worker therefore can't be permitted to treat her. The advice I can give to the mother is to take the child to a big health centre immediately. I can go ahead and escort her as well because her child's health is in danger at that moment. That's my reply to today's question."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Thanks	NA	NA	NA	CHW	"Now for today's question of Annette asking for treatment for her itching ears, I personally refer her to the health centre to get pain killers. They can also examine her and if they have no medicine for her problem, they can write it down for her to get it from any pharmacy. If she insists on getting antibiotics I explain to her that I examined her ears and there's nothing like pus or perforations. Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication. I strengthen her and advise her to go to the health centre for medicine that can stop that itching. In case they don't have it, she can get it from the pharmacy after them writing it down. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much."
Supportive environment	Communication and information - training	Supportive environment - Greetings	Supportive environment - Religion	Supportive environment - thanks	NA	CHW	" Good morning my brothers and sisters. Thanks for the work you're doing. We thank God for the rain today. Greetings Catherine and Bryan. How are you Andrew? How's everything? Thank God who has kept you while there. I have seen today's question and this is my reply. If I examine and find no problem like wax, pus or even a hole, it means the skin has an infection. Another reason is some people have allergies and may not be aware. Ears react faster than any other body part. That's my reply. It's either allergy or a skin infection. Rubbing them to ease the itching is also another one. The more someone does it, the more it itches. Thank you."
