Harriet your question is so good and it's always good to know something before you get a problem. This is my reply to you. A snake or rather it's body doesn't have any poison but there's a specific place where that poison is. I remember sending you a picture of a woman eating a snake. A lot of people eat snakes like Chinese, Phillipinos and others. Let me look for that photo and send it to your inbox. It means when an insect eats it, it cannot affect you.

Some of our VHTs had made a mistake of mobilizing the people to come on 5th where some were asking for loud speakers to pass through people while informing them like those of Kirijja butooke which is not right.  The right thing is that one you are trying to clarify, because even me I was here today and a certain lady who was in church and she said they were told in church to go to the Health Centre for treatment. I forwarded another one to you who was also having the same information, I told her to come to you for assessment first, and if her problem is worse that's when she will be able to see the Doctor."

We joined this but there are those who have nothing to do and those who do have what to do. One will not go around announcing. They know how they do their stuff. You need to go slow. You've turned it into a song. When you move around working in the communities, people will see you and they will come to you. Don't think treating ears is the first thing we have had to do. We have treated lots of diseases and sensitized people on a lot of things. I feel like we have started fighting each other which implies we have got nothing to do. Talking a lot doesn't equate to hard work. Go slow and stop pointing out people's mistakes. May be they didn't intend to do it or meant to say something else. You have changed and have gone so far. This is like the 8th training since we were enrolled as VHTs. We have been with Isabella for sometime but have never got any finger pointing. Why is the pressure so much on this?

Thanks for today's work. Thank God who has kept us. Good morning our bosses Dr Andrew, Bryan, Catherine and Hannah. Thank you for the work you're doing for us. VHTs and our bosses, I would like your advice. In case one day I kill a snake and then after leave it somewhere, and then the insects eat apart of it but again comeback to my house.  In case those insects get in contact with things that I eat,  is it poisonous? Or if they bite me after eating the snake? Does it affect me? What happens exactly? Please advise me because a lot of people in my village may fall prey. That's my question. I request fellow VHTs, Doctor, Bryan, Catherine please tell me because I personally don't know. Thanks so much. Mulungi is sick with malaria and flue but I gave her treatment. May God be with you."

That is my second explanation about this issue."
