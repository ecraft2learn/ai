Case study - asking a question,Management of a patient,Peer-to-peer problem solving,Greetings,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,Group,Good morning. Perhaps  if someone actively has an ear problem and comes to you to seek help see them and treat them. However the reason I asked to remain with just makata seeta kavuule and kirujja was so you arent over whelemed with people. If they are in seeta nazigo parish though its ok to see as this is the area we have ethical clearance for. What do you guys think?

Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,Encouragement,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,Group, All very interesting views. I think then as VHTs you should be advocating for the poorer members of society to ensure they are treated fairly.

Management of a patient,Case study - feedback ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator ,Group,Hi vhts so the correct answer is that this is an infected preauricular sinus. It needs to be referred for incision and drainage at the health centre. They also need appropriate antibiotic tablets and they eventually will need to go to mukono HC4 to have the sinus removed to prevent the infection from happening again. It is not otitis externa
Case study - asking a question,Case study - feedback ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator,CHW ," Nora. Please see my previous answer to Karl. This is a good question - allergy can be caused by lots of things. Sometimes the person is born with it, other times they develop it over time. Noone knows the exact cause. What is important to know is that people can be allergic to lots of different things e.g. fur, dust, antibiotics, pollen, nuts, milk etc. The response also differs. For example some people have a minor reaction e.g. itching. Others have a very severe and dangerous reaction. Their lips swell up and their airway can close off. This more dangerous reaction is much rarer but important as the person can die."

Greetings,Encouragement,Greetings,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,Group,Good morning fellow VHTs. Those of you who are not answering the questions. Qiana comeon. 
Peer-to-peer problem solving,Management of a patient,Encouragement,NA,NA,NA,NA,Facilitator ,Group,Yes thank you so much to all vhts for these suggestions. Its hard. Ideally she needs to be in a health centre for a few weeks to get special treatment. But I don't think the mum can afford it and she has mental health issues meaning I don't think she can be responsible for the child. I agree with Karl. We should first involve the father and His parents. Some vhts should go in a group to inform them and try come up with a solution which the family think they can manage. If that fails a good samartian might have to accompany the child for a few days.
Case study - asking a question,Case study - response,Greetings,Patriotic message,Thanks,NA,NA,CHW ,Group,"How has your day been fellow VHTs? Thanks for the work you're doing for the country. Catherine, Bryan and Andrew, my regards to you. Thanks fellow VHTs for answering yesterday's questions. This is my answer to today's questions. The questions I would ask the mother of the child include how long the child has had the diarrhoea, if their stool is bloody or watery and if they have had any treatment like Oral Rehydration Salt"
Management of a patient,Case study - response,Thanks,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW ,Group,"The treatment I can give to Patricia who I find out is dehydrated after checking  is mixing for her ORS. After giving her the ORS, I study her situation and if the diarrhoea stops, I don't refer her. If it doesn't stop, I refer her to the nearest health centre for treatment. Thanks so much."
Management of a patient,Logistics,Thanks,NA,NA,NA,NA,CHW,CHW,Isabella are you back so that we can go wash the other old ladys ears as we agreed? Because the appointment time is about to reach so please hurry if we are going to reach this woman on time. Thanks so much.
