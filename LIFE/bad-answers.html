bad answer: Look for secretions, vomit, and any things that would block the airway.<br>
good answer:You need to dry their legs, their hands, their stomach, and even their head. You need to dry the whole baby. While drying see if the baby is breathing, is crying, or is pink. And stiumlate the baby as you dry.<br>

Do I need to dry every part of the baby?<br>
bad answer: The room might become warm with a heater, but it might not be warm enough for the baby, and hence, you still need to cover the body with a towel.<br>

<br>
After bagging why do I need to reasses?<br>
bad answer: Look for 5 seconds to see if the chest is rising, listen for any noises from the baby, and feel for any warm air coming from its mouth. If nothing then start bagging.<br>
good answer:The baby can have secretions that come up, that were not there initially, and so you still need to establish that the airway, the mouth is still clear and sometimes even in that motion of bagging, the neck might actually tilt, so you need to reassess and establish that the neck area, the head is in neutral position, and then you reassess the breathing, that the child, that the baby still needs an intervention in breathing. That is where you look, listen and feel. <br>

What should I do after it is breathing, has a good pulse, and has oxygen?<br>
