<h2>A Guide to Exploring the Intelligent Support Added to a Training App Designed for African Health Care Workers</h2>
<h3>WARNING: This works only on Chrome - tested on Windows and Android but hopefully works on other platforms as well.</h3>

When you visit <a href="https://ecraft2learn.github.io/ai/LIFE/?covid-scenario=1&listen">the web version</a> 
of the <a href="https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/news/new-covid-19-simulation-training-for-smartphones-helps-african-healthcare-workers-save-lives">
Oxford Universityâ€™s LIFE project's COVID-19 simulation training for smartphones</a>
you'll be able to ask questions while running the program and listen to answers.
</p>
<p>
<i>Note that the first time the app is opened it may take a while to load.
The speech interface can take even longer. You'll hear a message when it is ready.
</i>
</p>
<p>
The web app can answer several different kinds of questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Scenario specific questions</b>.
We have collected 27 questions and answers that may arise in the context of different stages in the app's Covid scenario.
Some questions ask for clarifications, e.g. "Where is the grandmother?" (in Scenario A) or 
"Why do we give antibiotics if Covid is a virus?" or "How would you assess AVPU in a sleeping baby?".
If your question matches one of these questions <i>and</i> is asked in the appropriate context of the app,
you'll see and hear our answer.
<a href="covid-questions.html#context-sensitive">See all the questions.</a>
</li>
<li>
<b>Africa CDC FAQ</b>.
If your question doesn't match any of the context-sensitive ones, the app will try to match
your questions with the 88 questions in the Africa CDC document
<a href="https://africacdc.org/download/covid-19-infection-prevention-and-control-your-questions-answered/">
COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control: Your Questions Answered</a>.
If the app considers what you asked is a paraphrase of one of these questions, it will speak and display the answer.
<a href="covid-questions.html#africa-cdc-faq">See all the FAQ questions.</a>
</li>
<li>
<b>COVID-19 Research Explorer</b>.
If your question doesn't match any of the above but it contains words such as "covid" or "coronavirus"
then your question is sent to
<a href="https://covid19-research-explorer.appspot.com">a search engine based on 100,000+ scholarly articles related to Covid-19</a>
developed by Google.
You can also directly query the research search engine by prefacing your question with "ask research explorer".
Exercise scepticism when perusing the results since many research papers are pre-prints or report on preliminary or tentative findings.
</li>
<li>
<b>Querying the WHO website</b>.
There are three ways of performing a Google search of the WHO website by saying:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Ask WHO advice for the public X</b>. The advice section of the WHO is queried with X.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ask WHO newsroom X</b>. The news section of the WHO is queried with X.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ask WHO publications X</b>. The publications section of the WHO is queried with X.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ask WHO X</b>. The WHO website is queried with X if it is not "advice", "newsroom", or "publications".
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
If you complete the scenario or press the <b>Quit</b> button, you'll be given the oppurtunity to help our project by
sending email containing questions it could and could not answer.
Do not include any personal information in the email.
