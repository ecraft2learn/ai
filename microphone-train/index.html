<ol style="margin-top:20px; margin-left:30px;">
<li>Train by clicking a <b>click to train</b> button and then saying the word (or making a sound).</li>
<li>Train each word or phrase at least 8 times.</li>
<li>Test by pressing the <b>start testing</b> button and say a word already trained.</li>

Don't worry, we aren't sending any audio recordings to a remote server.
All the machine learning is being done locally on device, and you can check out our source code on Github.
