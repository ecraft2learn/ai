            <p>This application generates text based on the method proposed by Claude Shannon. 
            It starts with a word provided by the user. Then, using the text of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, 
            it selects a random "page" from the book, finds the first occurrence of the current word in that 
            page, and selects the word immediately following it as the next word. This process repeats to 
            generate a sequence of 1000 words.</p>
