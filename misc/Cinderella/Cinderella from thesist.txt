Your task is to generate description of how the characters in the following story should move in detail.

Cinderella is physically both beautiful and shabby. She is good,
friendly, hard working, and shy. Her stepmother is ugly, mean, selfish,
strong and evil. Her stepmother hates and dominates Cinderella, who
is obedient and tolerant of her. The fairy godmother is pretty, magical,
good, kind and strong. Cinderella is polite and grateful to her fairy
godmother, who is protective of Cinderella and helpful. The Prince is
handsome, strong, good, stubborn, and determined. Cinderella and the
Prince love each other.
In the first scene, which is longer than average, the personalities of
Cinderella and her stepmother and their relationship are established.
Both characters are slightly happy. The next scene is also long and in
it is conveyed that Cinderella wants to meet the Prince, that her
stepmother prevents that meeting and then Cinderella becomes very
unhnppy while the stepmother becomes happy and proud. In the next
rather short scene the fairy godmother undoes whatever the
stepmother did in the earlier scene that prevented Cinderella from
meeting the Prince. The next scene is long and in it is conveyed that
Cinderella and the Prince are alone, then that Cinderella "gets it on"
with the Prince, and finally their relationship is established (that they
love each other) and both become very happy. In the last scene the
stepmother becomes aware of this and becomes very unhappy.
In addition, the film should be moderately varied, simple, very coherent,
obvious, energetic, not very flashy or original and last between 2 and
5 minutes. The film should focus on the characters, especially
Cinderella. The scene in which Cinderella meets the Prince and the
scene where she is kept from him should be focused upon. Also the
relationship between Cinderella and her stepmother are part of the
focus.
