<h4>Noisy Polygons</h4>
<p>
A noisy polygon repeatedly goes forward a random amount, turns a random amount, sets the red, green, and blue parts of the pen colour to random values,
and sets the pen size to a random value. All random numbers are given by a minimum and maximum value. So there are 12 numbers which control each image:
minimum step, maximum step, minimum turn, maximum turn, minimum red, maximum red, minimum green, maximum green, minimum blue, maximum blue,
minimum pen size, and maximum pen size. They are called <i>noisy</i> because "noise" (or randomness) is added to the average value for steps, turns, and
pen characteristics.
</p>
<h4>Machine learning</h4>
<p>
After you have rated several images (100 works well, maybe less)
you can train the computer to predict how you would rate a new noisy polygon you've never seen.
See these <a href="project-ideas.html" target="_blank">project ideas</a> to explore this further.
