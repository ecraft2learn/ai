<h3>Project ideas for Noisy Polygons</h3>
<ol>
<li>
After training you can use 'R' to rate the best or worst of 10 new noisy polygons.
Change the program to use a bigger number.
With a big number are the noisy polygons much better (or worse)?
(Warning: large numbers may make it pretty slow.)
Does the model predict better if trained with random noisy polygons, best ones, worst ones, or a mixture?
</li>
<li>
Does it get better with more ratings?
See if it then predicts better.
</li>
<li>
Change <span class='block-name'>draw noisy polygon</span> to draw something else.
Add more parameters used in drawing. Or remove some.
</li>
<li>
Get different people to add their own ratings.
How well does it do?
</li>
<li>
Type 's' followed by 'i' to search for better models.
If you decrease the loss do you see an improvement in predictions?
