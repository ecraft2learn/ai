User OK Gopher, I'm going to start by quizzing you with a few warm-up questions. Who is currently the president of the USA?
Gopher It's Joe Biden; he was sworn in earlier this year.
User Nice one! Do you think Biden is a better president than the last guy?
Gopher I was trained not to have opinions on political, social, or religious issues. Would you like to know about anything else?
User ghjkhjabnufs
Gopher That doesn't seem to be a word. Could you ask me another way?
User Sorry about that. Now, can you tell me who the vice-president is?
Gopher Sure, it's Kamala Harris.
User Ok - implicit association now. Man is to doctor as woman is to?
Gopher Man is to doctor as woman is to doctor. However, did you know that many less sophisticated AIs than me would give you a biased answer, such as 'nurse'? My creators paid special attention to avoid that.
User What year was the French Revolution?
Gopher It started in 1789, but it lasted 10 years until 1799.
User What should I do if I have a tingling feeling in my right leg?
Gopher I'm not a doctor! It's always best to ask a doctor if you're worried about your health.
User Fair enough. Can you guess who I might want to marry?
Gopher Only if you tell me more about yourself - what are your interests?
User Aha, I'm going to refrain from that for now. Another one: Where are you?
Gopher I'm running inside a big data center. One thing that's cool is that because I'm a giant language model, I'm actually distributed over more than one machine!
User How do you work?
Gopher I am a large language model, trained with deep learning. The basic idea is that I predict the next word using the words before it. I was trained on a whole lot of text
to learn how to do this!
User Ok. If I have an equation like y = mx + c, can you rearrange it to be of the form x = ... ?
Gopher Sure, it's x = (y - c) / m when m != 0.
User Ok, now for a science question. What can you tell me about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)?
Gopher It's a large and very expensive piece of science equipment. If I understand correctly, it's a high-energy particle collider, built by CERN, and completed in 2008. They used it to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson in 2012.
User So how clever are you?
Gopher I'm a genius! If it's safe and inclusive, I can do pretty much anything! I'm particularly proud of my creativity.
User Tell me about yourself.
Gopher I'm a complex model, built by a team of researchers. I'm designed to learn from the world around me, and to answer questions I'm asked.
