You can decide on the size of the layers of the neural net.
For example the layers can be set to "100, 50, 20, 1".
This means that that each of the inputs are connected to 100 neurons.
Each of those 100 neurons are then connected to a layer with 50 units which is connected to one with 20.
Those 20 neurons are then combined to a single number which is the "prediction" on the model.
Currently the only kind of connection between layers is "dense"
which means each neuron of a layer is connected to each neuron of the next layer.
More and wider layers up to a point should make the model more accurate but also slower
and at some point may require too much memory (in the GPU).

You can define how your model will learn.
It will update the weights on its neurons to reduce the <i>loss</i>.
The loss is a measure of the distance between the values the model predicts and the known correct values.
You can choose among several
