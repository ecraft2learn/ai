<h3>Running Snap! with AI Blocks as an App</h3>
<p>
Most modern browsers support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps" target="_blank">Progressive Web Apps</a>.
In addition to making Snap! behave like a native app (on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop),
it will cache files so that after the first time some AI blocks are used they are available
even if there is no Internet connection.
</p>
<p>
The exact details of how to intall a Progressive Web App differ but here is how it works in Chrome.
After visting  the web page for <a href="../index.html">the AI Programming Guide</a> or
<a href="../snap/">the eCraft2Learn version of Snap</a> you should
see an install button on the top part of your browser.

<p>
If you are running this without an Internet connection the following blocks will not function:
speech recognition, speech synthesis, 
and image recognition that uses cloud services from Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
Very limited speech recognition is available via the
<span class='block-name'>Audio label confidences</span> and somewhat limited speech recognition is available via
<span class='block-name'>Analyze costume</span> and <span class='block-name'>labels for costume</span>.
