Instead of "manually" searching for optimal values for hyperparameters
such the learning rate, optimization method, number of layers, etc. the search can be automated.
The idea is to create, train, and evaluate the model with different hyperparameter values to find
the one with the lowest error in its predictions.
For optimization methods and loss functions it chooses randomly among the options.
For the number of training iterations (sometimes called "epochs") it picks random numbers between
one half and double the current setting.
For number of layers it generates six variants of the current setting:
</p> 
<ol>
<li>
increase the size of each layer by at most a factor of 2 (except last one which is the output)
</li>
<li>
decrease the size of each layer by at most a factor of 1/2 
</li>
<li>
insert a new layer of the same size as the first layer
</li>
<li>
insert a new layer up to double the size of the first layer
</li>
<li>
remove the first layer (unless it is the only remaining hidden layer)
</li>
<li>
keep the current list of layers
</li>
</ol> 
<p>
You can use the settings to control which hyperparameters are searched and how many searches to perform.
