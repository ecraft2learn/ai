<h2>An explanation of the how the AI Question and Answer Snap! project works</h2>
<p>
The project loads two similar models that were trained to produce one of six labels given a sentence.
The models were generated with the same program but with a different split of the data between
training and validation.
The average of their confidences that each label is correct is used to answer questions.
</p>
<p>
The models were the result of <a href="hyperparameter-search.html">five hyperparameter searches</a>.
Each search explored twenty variants and then replaced the current model with the best one found
if it is better.
See the <span class="block-name">search and replace</span> block to see how this was implemented.
</p>
<p>
The project splits the data into training, validation, and test datasets in such a way that they each contain
the same number of each category of question.
See the <span class="block-name">create training and validation data</span> block.
</p>
<p>
The project turns sentences into lists of 512 numbers using the 
<span class="block-name">features of sentence</span> block.
This relies upon <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/universal-sentence-encoder">the universal sentence encoder</a>.
</p>
<h3>See if you can do better</h3>

Or replace the data with your own.
