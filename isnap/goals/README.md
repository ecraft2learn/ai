# Snap Goals #

This is a small plugin that allows an instructor to define objectives/goals for their assignments, which students can view and check off as they work.

### Setup ###

This plugin depends on [Snap Logging](../logging/README.md). To configure goals, make sure to first configure logging and define your assignments. Then simply copy [config.js.example](config.js.example) to `config.js` and edit for your own objectives.
