Training a computer to play Tic Tac Toe

<h3>Tutorial</h3>
<p>
To train the computer to play Tic Tac Toe we'll need to generate records of game play.
The simplest way to start is for the computer to simulate both players making random (legal) moves.
For every board position it associates whether it eventually led to a win for X, O, or a tie.
The trained model on each turn will then consider all possible moves and consider their relative scores.
You can choose whether the trained computer player just picks the highest scoring move 
or uses the scores as probabilities of making that move.
</p>
<p>
Let's start by having the computer play games where both players just make random moves.
You can choose how many games it will play in the settings panel that will appear.
</p>

<p>
Now let's define how the computer will learn.
You can choose the learning rate which determines how much progress it can make on each training iteration.
Larger numbers makes the training faster but less accurate.
You can also decide on the size of up to three "hidden layers" of the neural net.
The default numbers are 100, 50, and 20.
This means that that each of the nine inputs corresponding to the nine board positions are connected to 100 neurons.
Each of those 100 neurons are then connected to a layer with 50 units which is connected to one with 20.
Those 20 neurons are then combined to a single number which is the "score" for a board.
If you want fewer layers then set the third (and second) layer to 0.
More and wider layers up to a point should make the model more accurate but also slower
and at some point may require too much memory (in the GPU).

<p>
Now let's train the computer using the games you just generated.
You can set the number of iterations the training algorithm will take.
Each iteration the program adjusts the weights of the neurons to increase accuracy.
You can see the best number of iterations from the graph by selecting the point where it starts to level off.

<p>
How good is the computer at playing Tic Tac Toe now that you've trained it?
One test is how well does it score the first move for X.
The center and corners should score higher than the others.
</p>
<p>
Another way to evaluate the training is to have it play lots of games (you can decide how many in the Settings panel).
You can have the trained model play against itself or against a player that makes random moves.
If the player using the trained model always picks the highest scoring move then every game will be the same.
Another strategy is to use the scores to determine the probability of making that move.
High scoring moves are more likely than others but all moves (except 0 scoring moves) can occur.

<p>
You can save a trained model to the local file system to load at a later time.

<h3>Things to try</h3>
<p>
Try different layer sizes for the model.
Larger ones may lead to more accuracy at a cost of speed and memory usage.
The learning rate is also worth exploring.
One approach is to split the training up where each subsequent training session has a significantly smaller learning rate.
Also set the number of iterations so that the learning is just leveling off so no need to waste time with more training.
</p>
<p>
In addition to experimenting with different parameter settings,
one can use games played by trained players to do further training.
The default settings is that games created during the evaluation phase are added
to the dataset of games available during training.
