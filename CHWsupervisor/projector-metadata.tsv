C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	For the benefit of you guys. Luke found a patient yesterday on a home visit with a very bad infection of the leg. The patient was going to stay at home but we advised them to go to Mukono District Health Center 4 in town and be seen by the doctors. This is important as the infection was very bad and the woman could die if this spread to the bone. Some were worried about the doctors wanting to ask for money. Remember that the government health centers are free. Anyone who asks for money should be directly challenged and the patient should take the doctors name. They should report this to you as VHT and you report to OmniMed. We will then make sure this is seen to by the District Health Officer Dr. Tumashabe. Remember, VHTs are the voice of the people.	logistics	TRUE	QA	none

Me, I can work 2 days a week on someone's households. So we can make arrangements on various days, move around as a group of VHTs. This will be better than walking alone. Another thing we will reach a point where we are all good and we can correct each other. So what I see is that by working together we can improve each others knowledge.

You see, I'm not Mr. Matthew's age and I at least know something but it still challenges me. If you get time, you can go and teach him since you know better.

What I don't want that most of you use is speed and commanding. We joined this but there are those who have nothing to do and those who do have what to do. One will not go around announcing. They know how they do their stuff. You need to go slow. You've turned it into a song. When you move around working in the communities, people will see you and they will come to you. Don't think treating ears is the first thing we have had to do. We have treated lots of diseases and sensitized people on a lot of things. I feel like we have started fighting each other which implies we have got nothing to do. Talking a lot doesn't equate to hard work. Go slow and stop pointing out people's mistakes. May be they didn't intend to do it or meant to say something else. You have changed and have gone so far. This is like the 8th training since we were enrolled as VHTs. We have been with Isabella for sometime but have never got any finger pointing. Why is the pressure so much on this?

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Qiana what you are saying to do about seeing the patients is what you should go ahead with because they said only those who have been examined will be seen in order to avoid big numbers.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hi Isabella, I was suggesting about the other issue where we mobilized people remember we had told all them that all those with ear problems should come at the Health Centre to be assessed on 5th, which is not right, we are supposed to assess them firs before referring them to the Health Centre. So I was suggesting that since we are heading to another Sunday, you go there and clarify on the information and tell them how it is going to be. Where you can't reach you can write to them letters in churches around them because they may mobilise a lot of people who may take a lot of time.	logistics	TRUE	QA	none
C&I-SE	C&I	SE	How are you Harriet, thank you for the clarification about the Doctor who is coming on 5th. Some of our VHTs had made a mistake of mobilizing the people to come on 5th where some were asking for loud speakers to pass through people while informing them like those of Kirijja butooke which is not right.  The right thing is that one you are trying to clarify, because even me I was here today and a certain lady who was in church and she said they were told in church to go to the Health Centre for treatment. I forwarded another one to you who was also having the same information, I told her to come to you for assessment first, and if her problem is worse that's when she will be able to see the Doctor.	logistics	FALSE	SE	C&I

C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Greetings Edward, about that issue as I said, its better to work together as team, if there are VHTs who will not be able to come this side due to distance, we who are nearer  can work as team like those around Seeta, Kavule and Makata.

Now personally I have a patient I worked on, went to her place, got to the stage of putting oil in her ears and then gave her an appointment to wash them on Friday. On that day she pretended and went away so I didn't find her there but saw her the following day on Saturday. When I asked her why she was no where to be seen, she said she had gone to Seeta. I told her since she goes to the born again church in makata I would do the ear wash out from there to which she objected. However, much as I saw her today she pretended and went away without me working on her. I am going to give up on her because I don't want to force her. Perhaps she doesn't want her ears treated. Also, there's a message Dr. Andrew sent us saying he will be with us on Monday at the health centre in Seeta but I'm not sure of the time. Those who are aware please let me know so  that I'm in position to keep time. Thanks.	logistics	FALSE	C&I	none

Now, there's a lady in Makata who went to Seeta but I'm not sure who she found there because she was referred to us to treat her and give her a form.

C&I-SE	C&I	SE	I greet you all my fellow VHTs. On this day of 7th March, I would like to thank you all for the work you're doing considering my current situation. Good enough, I may recover. I was told to go back to Wandegeya on Saturday for examination because the doctor wasn't there and I am supposed to go back with shs. 240,000. I have seen all the groups allocated but I haven't seen myself. I thank Dr. Andrew, his colleagues Catherine, Bryan, the two supervisors Dorothy and Edward and all my fellow VHTs. Let me wait for what the doctor will say and then go back after getting the money. I would also like to thank Dr Andrew for organising another training to ensure we do our work diligently like including the date, showing the affected ear and the specific disease. Thanks so much and if possible I'll attend it.  May be that's when you will put me in a group of your choice.	logistics	FALSE	SE	C&I

There's some hearing loss but if he places something like a phone near it, he's able to hear properly. And when he removes it, he loses his hearing again. What should I do for that patient? I've examined both ears and there's nothing like wax or anything. Please advise me on what to tell him so he goes home satisfied.	logistics	FALSE	QA	SE

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings Mr. Edward and well done! You're asking about the announcement Mr. Matthew just talked about but I think he takes long to check his phone. Bryan made that announcement longtime ago on 16th and it has already passed.

I cannot give someone who isn't sick medicine. I have explained to him that I cannot give him any medicine because we only work on people who have wax by washing their ears, those with perforations and pus. You referred him to me but I couldn't give him any medication because there was no problem. I think that's the patient you have been trying to talk about up there.	logistics	FALSE	QA	none

SE-SE	SE	SE	Good morning VHTs thanks for the work you are doing. Doctor gave us this announcement but no one replied to it yet - maybe you have not read it yet. He wanted to know if you'd like any other training besides the ear. Would you want any questions on topics besides ears? If there are please inform him! Give us the reason why too. That is the information he wrote last time. But we would like to hear from you so we can get to know what you think.	logistics	TRUE	SE	C&I
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Mr. Bryan good morning sir and other VHTs. That thing confused me personally. Someone who has ear problems how can someone with ear problems be treated if we don't have the equipment. Among the ones like antibiotics. What do we do in that case? Just refer?	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning my fellow VHTs, according to what Doctor Andrew is asking about, I thought may be he is asking about what we could add on from what we were taught, but I also thought that the people who taught us, are the ones who knew where we stop in what they taught us, so we don't know much details  about ears beyond what we were taught, but what I would like to know is that in my work, I always find patients who have itching in the ears yet we were told not to give anything to that person so my question is, how does such a person get treated? Because some use sticks to itch the ears which may be harmful, another thing is that we get a person who has pain in the ears, and you examine the patient when he/she has nothing that may be causing the pain for example without much wax, but the person says he has pain in the ear, we were taught that such a person should be given pain killers, but we haven't got any training about using pain killers or even getting them, I suggest that if we get trained about those who need pain killers and also understand how long the pain has taken for the person we are giving pain killers. Thank you so much.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my fellow VHTs, Am the usual person greeting you as you know my name, according to me, what we need to know more about is how to use the hook to remove the wax, I humbly request for a training in how to use the hook to remove the wax, because most of the patients I have found, you may give them olive oil and when you are going to washout, you find the wax when it has moved near the ear canal at the entrance which may need to be removed by the hook. I would suggest that we get training about using the hook and after that we get pain killers because truly, people know that the treatment is for free as you know things of Uganda and also a village can not be the same as it is in town, if someone expects that treatment is free and the person comes with a problem with the ears, when the person has pain, and itching, you examine the patient may be you find when the ears are normal but with itching and pain or when they have any abnormalities but sincerely the patient goes back with only olive oil without any pain killers to reduce on the pain and yet you trained us about the pain killers. I request Doctor to add that in our work so that our work can be good instead of someone coming and complaining that I took my ears thinking they are going to help me, I had pain and yet they are telling me to go and buy pain killers for 1000 shillings to relieve the pain. I would suggest that we get the pain killers, or capsules like dicrophenac or Panadol, like if we are given a tin of Panadol tablets such that a patient can go when he/she has the pain killers and the guidance on how to use them alongside olive oil if they have wax, other than someone saying they examined me but I didn't get any treatment yet I have pain, now like the patient I referred to Bryan, up to now he says the ears are still itching, he is using olive oil and he will be washed out tomorrow. Or if there is medicine which can be used to reduce itching in the ear, they should be given to us so that we are sure that we have tackled the problems of ears because you told us that if a person has itching in the ear, leave him or without wax, so shall we leave the person to use sticks because we have no where else to refer them, I request Andrew to make that improvement, that's what I think and also my colleagues that I work with. Thank you so muck Bryan	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Edward please clarify for me what you mean by that. I don’t think olive oil can treat 'greed'.	logistics	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The other problem we face about the ears is examining patients who have ringing in the ear or itching, we were not given any specific medicine about it, I was requesting Andrew to do that research when  he comes back on how to treat such people, I suggest that we need more clarification and training about such patients because we find many of them when we are in the field especially ringing in the ear and itching, that is what I was suggesting that we need more knowledge about treating such people.	logistics	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Me I would like to know more about the outer illness called sinus,  they say in most cases the child is born with it, but what could be the cause for the disease of sinus on the outer ear because you may go in the field and someone comes to you with such a problem and the person asks you how it is caused. I would like to know what brings sinus. Thank you so much.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings Andrew, my phone had no battery and I was also sick, I had problems with my throat which had changed my voice and I was in a hospital, but me mostly I find patients with eye problems, they always say tell Doctor to help us with eye diseases as well, I don't know if you can add it on the cases. That is what I was suggesting, am  Jane from Kirijja Butooke.	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for the reply. To answer Edwards point about itching ears. Itching of the ears can be caused by many things. 1. It can actually be caused by putting sticks or cotton buds into the ear... the sticks inflame the ear canal even more and keep the cycle of itching going. 2. It could be the sign of an early skin infection in the ear canal. If the ear canal is very red that might be a sign of infection. 3. It could be caused by a skin problem 4. It could be caused by a lot of wax.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	For the pain killers you can give between 500mg - 1g of paracetamol up to four times a day for an adult.	logistics	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	That should be provided by the health center. But if you can't get it there it is easy and cheap to buy over the counter at a pharmacy. Or even steroidal ear drops can help. XBeta is a brand of drop.	logistics	TRUE	none	none
C&I-QA	C&I	QA	Thanks for this suggestion Luke. About the ear hook - we can't do training in that as we don't have permission from the ethics board. The problem with the ear hook is that there is a danger that you can perforate the ear drum . If you find a patient who needs wax removing with the wax hook inform us here and we can come do it.	logistics	FALSE	QA	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you Karl. Sinus is caused from birth. It is a slight abnormality. When the baby is forming in the womb, there are special parts called 'arches' that form the babies mouth, eyes, ears etc.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The first and second arch form the ears - they don't fully close which is why you see a small hole, or 'sinus'/	logistics	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Most of the time that sinus (or small hole) is ok, but sometimes that sinus can get infected and swollen. That is why we recommend they visit the specialist to have it removed to prevent the infection from occurring.	logistics	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you Andrew. Greetings my to you all, my suggestion is that we need additional cases like malaria, cough, diarrhoea because this diseases are common in our area and they are the most which disturb our children and also adults. Thank  you so much	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings Bryan, Catherine and Andrew, Thanks for the work you are doing, my suggestion is that sometimes I go in the field and I find patients with wax, but in most  cases even if I give the person olive oil, they may put the drops up to the last day of the washout and after the washout, the wax still remains. Don't we have any other medicine that works more than olive oil? Because that wax brings problems like ringing in the ears and itching so even if you give olive oil and do the washout, the issue remains, also about the eyes, people between the age of 60 and above also complain about ears and we find many of them who have pain of the eyes. Is there any help we can give them? Because some may not have ear problems but complain about eyes and yet you don't have the medicine, how can we help such people we need knowledge about this. Thank you.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you so much Andrew for the information you shared yesterday, what I would like to learn more about, you may find a person with too much pus in the ear, even if you washout the ear, the pus doesn't stop or reduce, my question is, is there somewhere that the pus hides in the ear drum? And if yes, doesn't it affect someone when the pus hides somewhere in the ear? Can't the pus go through the mouth and accidentally someone eats it and gets another problem? Am still wondering about this and it confuses me whereby I need to learn more, and lastly the holes in the ear drum, how are they caused?	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	On the same case, we would like to talk about the issue of eye diseases becaut many people complain about eye problems, especially the adults like old people, when are we having training about the eyes, you told us that the ears work together with the eyes, there are many people who have problems of the eyes, will you also help us with the training so that we can also treat people with eye diseases or have knowledge about eye problems?	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my fellow VHTs, thanks for today's work, about that issue I agree with the other VHTs, because I also find patients who have much wax from birth, some have itching in the ear but when I look into the ears I can't see any problem, and the patient may ask what are you going to do for me? Are you going to leave me like this? Even if you have pain killers because some come with pain in the ear,   it is a good idea to have the pain killers so that we can give them, even the children we find with wounds outside the ear, they may be normal inside but when the outer ear has wounds, I would suggest we also have a case about the issue most especially the children with wounds, I have found many of them and parents ask me what to do for them, that is my issue. I wish you well.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Isabella. We will try create some cases around these issues you mention.	logistics	TRUE	SE	SE
QA-QA	QA	QA	Ok - to clarify -- OLIVE OIL IS NOT A MEDICINE. The olive oil just softens the ear wax to try max it easier to washout. It has no medical benefit.	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If you do the washout, but it still fails after you have tried simple washout then make a note of this patient and refer them to us so we can try doing the washout at the ear camp in May. For the eye issue, we will try put together some basic training. It is important we distinguish between eye pain and poor vision though. If it is poor vision there isn't so much we can do as they may need surgery or glasses. If it is an eye infection then they could have antibiotics but we need to try see if we can do some proper training.	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-QA	C&I	QA	Hi Qiana. We can look into the pain killer issue. If you find a child with wound on the outside of the ear, first make sure the wounds are clean and not infected. Second, if the wounds are infected and it is in the ear canal or around the ear they need antibiotic drop. If it is on the pinna they need antibiotic cream.	logistics	FALSE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I think the first set of new cases we will do in addition to ears will concern diahorrea, malaria, pneumonia, TB, HIV etc. As these are common and there are services at the health center to refer these issues to.	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none

SE-C&I	SE	C&I	I also greet you all, those who have started  the weekend and to the seventh day people I also great you. The truth is if that hole doesn't pain the person, there is no problem, but if it pains the patient, then you have to refer the patient to Catherine and Bryan at Omni Med and if it is swollen still you have to take it to the specialist or Catherine and Bryan, that is my suggestion.	logistics	FALSE	QA	none
SE-QA	SE	QA	Greetings my fellow VHTs, what I think about that patient, even if its swollen and though there is no pain, it may still have complications in the future, it may start to pain the person.

Andrew gave me the answers to them Luke I talked about giving the medicine to Dorothy and Edward, to give to you instead of coming to Omni Med because of the long distance but Dr. says if you need it you can always inform us then we get to you as soon as possible - you don't need to come to the organisation. Harriet - you said you always look for patients, to give them medicine but doctor says you don't need  to force them to give them medicine. Also Mr. Matthew the lady who has pain on the tragus - don't force her. Just sensitise her and leave the decision to her for treatment. Norah you said some patients feel pain after washout but the pain will cease so tell them not to worry. Bwindi you said some patients don't follow instructions which makes your work difficult - you just need to explain the work they need to do and emphasise the importance of this. Patricia concerning your case you can go vest other households around you. Accompany other VHTs on their visits. Nora for X who has recurring pus - wash her ears again and give her antibiotics again. Luke about the data - we will upload you new data. Meanwhile top up your data using your salary. Harriet about patients getting dizzy after washout - tell them not to worry. This is normal. It ceases after a few days. Thanks alot if anyone has any questions feel free to ask.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none

Is it only mine with a problem? Or they face it and they don't take it seriously? Because the truth is whenever I travel by such vehicles I get a lot of complications, like pain in the ear, outside the ear, pain on the pinna also I end up not hearing well, are those people not affected especially those who move on big trucks that carry sand or firewood for long distances I need to know why it is like that? Thank you.	logistics	FALSE	SE	C&I
SE-SE	SE	SE	Greetings Harriet. Sorry about that problem but as soon as I heard it, I might have got it wrong but my guess was you have an allergy. Personally when I take a walk in coldness especially in the morning, my whole body itches and sometimes my tongue swells. But again you have said your pinna hurts and you experience itching.

Tomorrow is Sunday so I request you to follow up any patients you may be having. I say that because it's the most convenient day for that since most people are home all day. My plan is for us to finish up with the already seen patients and then we can embark on seeing new ones in order to attain the numbers we started with or more. Isabella my dear I have been told you're in pain but may God heal you. The rest of you, I wish you a good evening. Those who went for prayers today like Isabella, we thank God.

SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Greetings Harriet and sorry about that situation. You're not the only one who experiences it. When I travel on a pick up too and I get affected by too much wind, I feel pain in my ears. It feels like piercings inside and around the ear. Compare it to suddenly jumping into water and then you feel pain on your stomach. When you get used to it, the problem ceases to be one. Or if someone pours water on you at once without doing it slowly, you still experience pain. Now the speed of the car is the reason as to why you feel that way but if it's slow, you can't experience it. I don't think there's any other cause.	logistics	FALSE	C&I	SE

Thank you for your advice.	logistics	FALSE	C&I	C&I
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	VHT Oliver what you are going to do is to stop using pick ups and trucks, not in a bad way but if you know that is where the problem comes from, because even the Bible says avoid any ways that bring harm, so when you think that it will affect you, don't use the open cars, there is nothing to do.	logistics	TRUE	none	none

I request all those who have patients to be seen to inform them so they can be reviewed on that day. Thanks so much supervisor. May god reward you in everything. For caring for us in every way. May god provide you for everything you put your hand in. One more thing I call my upon my fellow VHTs to teach the patients very well. When we talk about oil we don't mean the oil for cars, because someone asked me whether they said can it be any oil e.g. cars, bodas. So the person said I have some oil in my jerry can at home. So I asked them which kind of oil and they said that for bodas. So the patient was wondering if we should use that one. So I told them do not put that in the ear. I told them, we put another kind of oil and we are the only ones to have it and give you directions about how to use it. The one you are talking about can bring harm to the ear. It is not meant for the ear, it is meant for automobiles. I request all the VHTs to inform the people. Tell them exactly what type of oil to use. I wish you a good day but as a reminder we have a meeting at 2pm at the HC today. I request all who have heard to inform a friend.	logistics	TRUE	C&I	none

In case one day I kill a snake and then after leave it somewhere, and then the insects eat apart of it but again comeback to my house.  In case those insects get in contact with things that I eat,  is it poisonous? Or if they bite me after eating the snake? Does it affect me? What happens exactly? Please advise me because a lot of people in my village may fall prey. That's my question. I request fellow VHTs, Doctor, Bryan, Catherine please tell me because I personally don't know.

A lot of people eat snakes like Chinese, Phillipinos and others. Let me look for that photo and send it to your inbox. It means when an insect eats it, it cannot affect you.

But due to people's prayers, I'm now okay. When I got to the health centre, the doctors didn't know where to start from so they referred me. They had no idea what the condition was after explaining it to them. I will be fine only that we got a boda boda accident on our way.

C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Isabella, this is my response to you both. I would personally expect that when someone gets a problem, you let everyone know through the group. But if you feel obliged to sympathise with the person/ encourage them, it's better for you to send a personal message. If it's to give them money, others shouldn't know you passed by their home. That's what I think is the right thing to do. The people who should actually be passing on any information in this group are five or six. The one with the problem, Edward, Dorothy, Doctor, Bryan and Catherine. They are the ones to follow up and update us. The rest of us should message them personally.

It's not like we were addressing only Francesca but we were discussing something that concerns us all. Something to do with sickness. It wasn't a secret. Usually when I need to talk to someone personally, I contact them directly. I did that because we all felt her pain in the group. I suggested in the beginning that we should be there for each other. What Francesca went through concerns us all so there was no need for personal messages. If we made a mistake, forgive us.

I wanted to let my friends know the mistake we had done like you have heard Isabella say she's one of them.

I am reading over the photo interviews and one vht felt that the cause of pus in the ear was when milk accidently got into the ear and when the wax becomes too much it turns into pus.

SE-SE	SE	SE	About the other issue of milk in the ear, the milk they are talking about does not drop direct in the ear, for us in Buganda, the milk can drop on the knees when the mother is breastfeeding the baby, that is when people say that the baby got some milk drops in the ear, that is an infection that started long time ago, but in our tradition we have people who treat this, (traditional healers) but when we go to the doctors they say its pus but it is an infection in most cases a child is born with it. Have a good night am Johnson Matthew	logistics	TRUE	none	C&I
SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Still on the same issue, because this issue is so important, for us in Buganda we have traditional doctors who treat such an infection which can't be treated by other qualified Doctors, we have diseases which can't even be treated by white doctors  but when you use the traditional medicine you get healed, we have seen this for a long time but for us keep referring to medical doctors (bazungu) but we also have the medicine that heals that problem, it is an illness which sometimes fails to be healed by the qualified Doctors then they end up saying someone's ear has rotten yet it is an illness. That is my second explanation about this issue.	logistics	FALSE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs, welcome back from the meeting. But about this patient, X. The advice I can give to her mother after knowing the illness, acute otitis media. The advice I give her is to feed the child with the food which gives more energy because when the child is still young the body is weak. So the child needs more care. Covering her - feeding her and also giving her body building foods that can't be affected with the disease so the white blood cells can get more energy. That is my suggestion and idea and that is what I tell the mother. To give body building foods, beans, mukene (silver fish), soya, so that the body can have more energy and also that WBCs can be stronger. Thanks alot good night. I am your VHT Matthew, Makata.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Greetings members, thank you for all you are doing to see that we develop our community in Health, now there is a problem which may not be good to our coordinators, the way people are responding to questions is not encouraging. Some VHTs are not replying to cases for example like yesterday, I encourage you to respond to the cases and answer the question the way you understand it, because even if you are not right still in the evening we get the right answer, I also encourage you that whenever we get the answers let's go back to ours notes and remind ourselves about the issues we are learning about. I have understood that there is a book which will be put to show the way people respond to cases, so I don't know whether it will be showing the Marks and our performance, so I advise you all to be active. Another thing I am not sure about is whether Qiana receives her phone back but to those who have their phones, please let us use them to share ideas so that we can take this project ahead also to make our representatives happy, I know they were so upset yesterday. I wish you a good day.	logistics	TRUE	SE	none

Also, I request members of Kavule or Makata who could be knowing these people to help me let them know or direct me where they are so I could give them their medicine. Miss X, 27, Kavule and Miss X, 67, Kavule. I request whoever knows where they are to please direct me there so I could give them their medicine before tomorrow.

QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for all the work you're doing. Today I want to talk to you about the issue of the files. I would like us to work together whether one received a file or not. The reason I am saying that is because some people received files with people they didn't treat or who don't stay in their areas. If someone sends a name of a person from their file that they didn't treat or who don't stay in their area, the one who knows them should help and direct that person. Today someone else may be having a file but next time it will be you. I suggest we work together to make this work easy because it's 30th and almost June. It will be bad if we look for those people without finding them yet someone who could be knowing them just didn't let us know. An example is yesterday when Edward asked who knew the patients he listed down. I am not sure if you sent him a private message because I haven't seen anyone directing him. I therefore suggest we work together so we can finish the work that was given to us. This is not about only those who got the file but everyone. I will be happy if we help each other and do this work very fast.	logistics	FALSE	SE	QA
SE-C&I	SE	C&I	I would also like to remind those I will be moving with that I sent them an audio telling them we shall be meeting at the health centre developing a program. Please don't forget and keep time since what we shall be doing doesn't take much time. It could take less than an hour. If we keep time, we shall do what we are supposed to do and also go back and do other things. I remind you all that I sent private messages that today is the day we are meeting at 2pm. If there's anyone who would love to join us though they don't have a file, you're free to attend so we can share ideas and find out where our patients  stay. Thank you so much.	logistics	FALSE	C&I	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	It is me Harriet. I welcome the person then thank her for bringing the child to the hospital or health center. After that I introduce myself as a VHT. I then tell her everything about the patient. I take her consent and then begin asking her about the child. I then ask for permission to check the child's ear. Part B. I write the history in the book that was given to us, then I give her one copy and take one to the health center. Part C. I ask who the head of the house hold is, her name, then the name of the patient, then the age of the patient, where she stays, the date, which ear has the problem. Then I ask about the other patients in the household. I then ask if she has any other disease aside from ears. That is my answer to the question.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to the question. The first thing I do is to give the mother the consent forms. After she has signed them it means I have permission to examine the child. After signing I also sign to show that I am the one in charge of treating her. After that I introduce myself to her, tell her I am part of a project that is helping people with ear problems. After all that I ask for permission to touch her child's ears. After that I ask for her permission to write down the questions I ask about her child as I write in the book. I ask for her name, the name of the child and the age of the child and I write them down. I also write the village where she comes from plus the date and which ear has the problem. After that I check the hearing.  I ask her to put the child on the lap so that I can examine her. When I examine I the ear first which does not have the problem. If I find that the ear has a problem I give the child pain killers if I have them. If I don't - I refer the child. I note the problem with the ear in my book. In case I give the patient the pain killers and there is no change I follow up again and refer the patient	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you so much for replying to the question. Most of you have written the right answers. You refer the child to the specialist, ENT surgeon or Clinical Officer. Have a good weekend.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	1. Some patients are reluctant to go to government health centers as they feel they will be charged money to be seen even though it is mean to be free. How can you as VHTs address this issue? 2. Why do you think children in poorer areas have higher chances of getting Chronic Supportive Otitis Media than those in richer areas?3. Does anyone have any questions or did they not understand anything?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I will start with the second question, the reason as to why people who are poor normally get chronic supprativr otitis media is that in most cases poor people have no money to take them to the Health centre to get assessment and also treatment, that's why they end up using sticks when they've got a lot of wax in their ears, some stay in pain not knowing even where to go to get help, now like a disease for sickle cells in some places they offer free treatment but because of lack of transport to take them where there is free treatment, they get affected. Therefore they lose hope, even in Seeta Nazigo Health Centre, they may be offering free dental services but a poor person even fails to get 5000 shillings to bring him or her for treatment which is not the case which the rich.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Am Luke still on question number one, I will start by giving an example that when a fish rots, it starts from the head so the problem started in Mulago the biggest hospital where Doctors could say "those who came with something in the pocket where are you?" meaning only the patient with money is the one who is able to meet the doctor, so those who don't know the "money language" are left to suffer.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Therefore up to now people have that feeling the when you to any Government hospital without money, you won't get treatment so they fear staying in a line and at the end of the day they are not worked upon, but a rich person just goes  once and fast. People end up regretting for example pregnant mothers who go for antinental care and those who take their children for immunization, they say they wish they had money so that they can pay and be worked on fast like in a private health centre. I think it could be so easy if we had that system where we have enough doctors in health centres, this can save time and people will stop thinking of paying for the treatment, that's my view as Luke	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well-done everybody, am Jane, my point is that some patients don't want to go to the government Health Centres because they fear wasting a lot if time yet they don't get the medicine because free things normally are on demand by very many people yet the medicine is not enough for us. The answer to the second question is the reason why we get such diseases is because people don't maintain hygiene especially for their kids, and so the children grow even without cleaning their ears, they grow with a lot of wax which ends up affecting the middle ear, that's my view, but I also have a question, what brings otitis media in children?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all, the first question is a two way question which needs answers but also discussion according to people's opinions, paying money in hospitals used to be there some time back so people still have a thinking that when they go to the health centre they'll be asked to pay for treatment so people fear to even tell the health officers that they don't have the money yet the medicine is available for the second time as a VHT, what I could do is to inform the patients that there is medicine so that they can go there and that its free of charge, I also get a chance since  always at the Health centre to inform them whenever the medicine is out of stock and I tell the patient according to the illness to go to another Health centre where there is medicine.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Let me emphasise this. At the government health center there is some medicine that is not offered. Someone comes with a condition and sits from morning to evening. And later on when they see the health worker, they tell them they don't have that medicine and tell them to get it elsewhere. People think medicine is there, but it is just not there.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I think people in villages are prone to such diseases because of the conditions they live in. People cannot take good care of their children. They don't check their ears as they don't know about the problems it causes. This leads to disease like the one we talked about -  CSOM. I also have a question - what is the biggest cause of CSOM, especially amongst us?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The second question consists of too much poverty which is so high among the people so they can't afford to get the needs even the treatment, another view is that most people are so reluctant, it may also be due to ignorance whereby even if you have money and you are not aware of what to do, it becomes another problem, another issue they fear confronting the people due to status, they think they are high professionals who may take them as illiterates or people of a low status.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Others believe in witchcraft, where they get cheated of their money thinking that they were bewitched, if there was medicine at the health centre to cure the illness before it worsens, I think it could save people from going in referrals.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The second question, children from poor communities are prone to chronic supprative otitis media because poor people don't receive enough health services. Others have little understanding on health issues. Lastly, I request the teachers to explain to us the meaning of the word allergy.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to my fellow VHTs. As a VHT, this is  the way I can handle a patient who is reluctant to go to a government health facility because they're afraid they will be asked for money. I would encourage them to go there and assure them it's for free. I would also tell them to let me know if a health worker asks for money, so I can report them to the DHO and to prevent the vice.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to my fellow VHTs. As a VHT, this is  the way I can handle a patient who is reluctant to go to a government health facility because they're afraid they will be asked for money.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my answer to question 2. I think the reason as to why our children contract otitis media is because some parents are not hygienic. Some parents don't care. They fail to buy soap therefore the children go to bed without bathing. Sometimes they ask them to do it themselves. This is a 4year old who won't care about cleaning the ears. That's my view as Nora.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	For the third part, my question is what causes allergy? Greetings to you all and I wish you well as you attempt those questions. May God be with us and bless us.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I  am Isabella Kizza. People don't want to go to government health centres because their health workers don't care about patients. I think you all remember during the training the lady who almost died from there just because she was lacking water. That's the reason people would rather pay money in a private clinic where they care.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Why are children from poor communities prone to that disease? In the past, that disease wasn't taken seriously. Maybe those who have money knew about it. You see, even at our health centre there's no specialist to treat it. You find that a poor parent cannot take their child for examination because they don't have the ability.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As Gordon, this is my answer. Patients are reluctant to go to government health centres not because they are asked for money but because of long queues. They spend a lot of time waiting in line and after fail to receive the medicine. They're instead sent to get it from clinics. Another issue is the government health workers who happen to be very tough. Also, patients are given under dose. That's what stops them mostly. For the second question, children who grow up in village families don't get medical check up so they end up getting problems. On the other hand, their counterparts from town families tend to have rich families therefore receive enough care and medical check up. Most rich families are found in town. That's my view as Gordon.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my answer to the first question as Harriet. Some people are reluctant to go to the health centres because they're asked for money which is true. Much as they do ask for it, the government facilities have no medicine. You can only find it there once in awhile. Another reason is they take long to attend to the patients. Some patients can be very ill and decide to sleep around the health centre but when the nurses arrive they insult them instead. Some nurses are very rude but very good ones are there too.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As Harriet, I think children from poor communities are prone to diseases because some people don't take certain issues seriously. They know even if they find out about them, there's nothing much they can do. If at all they fail to get salt and eat food without salt! That's why some get knives and commit suicide. Therefore, if something is not preventing one from eating or drinking, it's not an issue. That's why poor children are affected because of need.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	For the third part, my question is why is it that amongst the diseases we are examining, women are the most affected. I don't get it. Thanks for participating, supporting and doing good work. God bless you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

Thanks for doing this project. There are so many people who have ear problems, but you have been able to help them. Even though some are still doubting I am sure they will get to know the project will help them.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I have a concern as Gordon. When you talk to patients about allergies, they don't understand. What is allergy? Does it mean changes in the body? I'd like to know it in our language.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you my fellow participants. People don't go to the government health centers because of the pain the have to endure. You have to wake up early to get there as soon as possible only for them to arrive at later hours. You then wait for long hours, and as you are finally about the get them, they break off for lunch. They then take long hours having lunch. If you have some little money you would rather go to a private clinic where you are more likely to receive immediate attention.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	My apologies to you all. This is my response to the second question. Why are village children prone to ear diseases? We villagers have our own way of reasoning that is different from town people. First of all we have no time to clean our children's ears. Even when they get a problem we poison them more. We mix several herbs and end up introducing germs in their ear which causes inner ear diseases.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my view on the questions. Some people are just lazy, other government health centers don’t care about the patients which frustrates them making them go to private clinics instead. Others decide to just sit home and wait upon the Lord to finally take them away from earth. Also people in the villages are so lazy and don't check their children's ears. Others swim in dirty water. But thank you Andrew for that training. And his team Bryan and Catherine. Thank you so much. That is my view.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	People don't go to the government health centers because of the long distances and medicine is never there most of the time. The other issue is about the time they take waiting for the nurses.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Children in villages get that disease because their parents don't seek advice on what treatment to give them. They instead go to witch doctors, instead of going to health centers. Those in urban areas have family doctors.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you Luke. This is an interesting point. Indeed it probably does not help that poorer children are unable to afford quick and prompt treatment. Fast treatment for CSOM with washout, drying and antibiotic drops is important. It is also very important to follow up the child regularly. It is your role as VHTs and esteemed community members to act as advocates for the people. You know that medicine should be free at the health centers. We therefore need to apply gentle pressure to the government officials to make sure this happens.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Interesting. So you have to encourage people to challenge those who demand money. For example - everyone has a boss. Even the doctor at the health center.. their boss is the in charge, the incharges boss is the DHO... encourage people to know their rights as citizens and to challenge those who abuse power. Get them to take their name and registration number. Then report this to LC1 and HC in-charge in formal writing, keeping a copy for yourself which can be used as evidence.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	All very interesting views. I think then as VHTs you should be advocating for the poorer members of society to ensure they are treated fairly.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Ok. Thank you Julliette. That is why keeping good records (as you are doing in your books) is important. That way we have a clear record of a. how many patients in the community have a problem b. using this evidence to petition the district and Health Center to show there is a need for good treatment and enough medicine.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	If we have evidence and are informed citizens aware of our rights and the needs of those who we serve then we are empowered.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Jane. Otitis media is a disease of poor hygiene and actually much more common in poor children than those from rich families. For example, in poor areas of Australia almost 70% of children has CSOM compared to the rich areas where it is only 1%. It is a disease of inequality.  It is common in areas of overcrowding, poor hygiene etc. If a child is exposed to a dirty environment and put things in their ears then they have more risk of introducing bacteria...	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you Karl . Very excellent points. To reply to your question - "allergy" means a reaction to something which the persons body is against. For example some people have allergies to dust which makes them cough, others are very serious such as some people are allergic to latex, nuts or cat fur.... there skins goes very itchy and swells up and they can even die if they have a very serious allergy.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Thank you Karl . This is excellent advocacy work and great citizenship.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I can understand their frustration Nora. That is why having the medicines as VHTs and going house to house is so important. You build trust and respect of the community like how you are doing with Anna Nabwire the 97 year old lady who you are treating with antibiotic drops. Imagine how hard it would be for her to go to Seeta Nazigo 3 times a day for treatment with drops. You are giving her an excellent service.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good point. The cause of CSOM is due to poor hygiene sometimes so encourage parents to keep their children's ears clean and dry.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Am Patricia, its true that big government hospitals ask for money which is not the case with other small Health centres, therefore as a VHT, the knowledge I give people who are poor and who can't afford to pay is that they should go to the Health centres instead of staying home, because at the health centres there are professional health officers who will examine them and tell them which illness is affecting them so they can buy the medicine at a lower price after knowing the cause of the illness, that's my view.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The second question, my answer is that people have poor hygiene, parents don't care about their children very well, they have low income earnings, poor clothing , they even fail to buy soap because of low income, a child may even spend three days without bathing which had caused diseases like otitis media due to poor hygiene.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Nora. Please see my previous answer to Karl. This is a good question - allergy can be caused by lots of things. Sometimes the person is born with it, other times they develop it over time. No one knows the exact cause. What is important to know is that people can be allergic to lots of different things e.g. fur, dust, antibiotics, pollen, nuts, milk etc. The response also differs. For example some people have a minor reaction e.g. itching. Others have a very severe and dangerous reaction. Their lips swell up and their airway can close off. This more dangerous reaction is much rarer but important as the person can die.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Gordon. This is true actually that poorer children get CSOM more. However there are also poor areas of towns where children suffer, especially in slum areas. The other big problem is timely treatment and also prevention. Remember, encourage adults to make sure their children don't pick at their ears, keep their hands clean and seek prompt advice and treatment if they have pus coming from their ear.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you for all your inputs Harriet. You have done excellent work this last few weeks. I like how you are working in pairs with Isabella. It is a good idea and other VHTs might consider going in pairs on their home visit or asking their supervisor (Edward or Dorothy) to accompany them once in a while. In answer to your questions why are women getting disease more than men.... It is unlikely that women are more affected, but women might be more likely to be at home when you do home visits compared to men who might be out. Also women might be more willing to say they have a problem compared to men who many deny any problems. This is a very interesting insight though.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

QA-QA	QA	QA	Well done Isabella. Welcome back from the church service. What are we going to do about Miss X? I haven't got a reply yet. I was suggesting we fix some time tomorrow evening and give her some antibiotics because of the wounds so she can get some peace. How do you see?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	It could be true because she has wounds. Also, this lady called X who had pus from the ears kept complaining of pain but I asked her and she said she no longer feels it. She also said she can at least hear a few words when someone speaks. We shall go back and check on her. Another thing, there's also X. When you look at Monday's program, I would like Andrew to see him as well. Thanks and good night.	case study	TRUE	QA	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Isabella, that issue you have pointed out about our patients is good . As for X, if only you had seen Doctor last time. Now X and her husband got lucky. They got for them a specialist who will be working on them. If you had brought that child for his ears to be examined, we would have gotten somewhere and doctor would have helped us. They would go at once with the rest because he will be the one driving them. Don't you see in his message?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

Amen.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-QA	C&I	QA	Gordon Byamukama, did you just move around? You should say you also examined. We haven't understood you really well.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	My fellow health worker Isabella, I haven't been so clear but I went to Samanya's home and treated the patients there. They had wax. But because I had run out of time, I only went to their nearest neighborhood and there after  decided to go back home. Those in Samanya's home had wax and I treated them all.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Byamukaka how about the other boy who does not speak or hear? The name you are using 'kasiru' means mentally disturbed, but it is better just to say that he can't hear.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

QA-QA	QA	QA	Byamukama, thanks for the work you are doing and I send my greetings to you. You have talked about the patient you found Mrs Namusoke who has puss in the ear and her ear drum looks like it has a hole in it. Before you put antibiotic drops, you first washout the ear after that you put the antibiotic drops, am not sure whether you got the kit, but if you haven't got the kit, you have to see Andrew to give it to you so that you can treat that patient.	case study	TRUE	SE	C&I
SE-SE	SE	SE	Byamukama, when a patient has puss in the ear, you have to do an ear washout after doing that as we do, you put the antibiotic drops because you like it or not such a patient must be having some wounds in the ear. That's what I think. What I had forgotten after the ear washout, you do ear mopping before putting antibiotic drops. Thank you so much	case study	TRUE	QA	C&I
C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Thanks Isabella and Harriet for the work you are doing you have really worked hard and thanks for winning airtime, but am suggesting that let's be patient and observant  because though Byamukama wrote the information in the case group, you were also not supposed to put it here at the VHT case group but rather the other one of Seeta Nazigo.	case study	FALSE	SE	C&I
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Because if you write here again, Gordon is also going to do the same, the Case group is for questions and learning. But all the challenges we get should be put in the other groups of Seeta Nazigo and Makata and that of Kirijja Butooke/Kavule group	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning. Perhaps  if someone actively has an ear problem and comes to you to seek help see them and treat them. However the reason I asked to remain with just makata seeta kavuule and kirujja was so you aren't over whelmed with people.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	My Dear VHTs. Have you understood the question?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	A)  Introducing yourself. Seeking for their permission to examine their ear. If they accept I examine them and take their history. B) I take their history in the book. C) I ask for the head of the household. The number of the people in the house hold. Age. How long they have had to pain. If they got any treatment. If so which treatment. I wash their ear and given them antibiotics. After that I follow up.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The important question I ask after taking the history is if they have any allergy. That's what I have to say.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I write the history in the other big book that was given to us. I write down my names, head of household who signed the consent form and the names of the patient, their village plus everything concerning their ears. For example they told me they feel some pain, so I ask how long they've had it. After that, I ask them if they have any other disease besides ears. When I'm done with that, I embark on examination for the second time since I would have finished the wash out and given them some pain killers. I then check their hearing using the whispered voice hearing test. After that I give them a copy of the form to confirm that I have successfully treated them and then I take the pink one to the health centre. As for the white one, I write in it like Dorothy told us i.e. the phone number of the patient and where they stay to help me remember.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question no.1) if I find that lady with pain and discharge, first thing I do is to give her some pain killers to reduce the pain. After that, I wash her ear. When I'm done washing her ear, I dry it. Next I put in antibiotic drops to heal the wounds. Three drops. I then let her go home. That's my answer to the first question. Question 2) I take her history but before that, I give her the consent form to confirm that she has accepted the treatment I will be giving her. I explain to her why she has to sign it. After accepting, I give her pain killers. When she says the pain has reduced, I do the ear wash out to remove the discharge. Next I dry it like I said in the first place. Another question, what important questions I'm I supposed to ask her. They include, how long she has had the pain, if she has had any treatment before and then I examine. After examining, I ask if she has any allergy. If she says she has, I call my bosses to inquire from them what to do like they told us.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all. When I go to see that lady in kirujja butoke, I first introduce myself to her i.e. Who I am and what I do. I ask her what she would like us to do because she may not want an ear wash out or she may want a specialist instead of me. I seek her permission and also explain to her that I can do it. When she grants me permission,  I examine her ears. If I discover there's discharge, I explain to her that we are going to wash those ears, dry them and then put antibiotics. Three drops three times a day for five days. I take the history in my book that has three sheets of carbon. When I'm done taking the history, I give her one copy and advise her to keep it. It helps me while doing follow up. I take another copy to the health centre and keep one in the book. After that, I ask for her names, the people who are apart of her household, her age, village, number of people in her household, how long she's had the condition and the treatment she's had so far. I ask her if she has any allergy. If she says yes, I request her not to use the medicine because it may cause complications. If she says no, I ask her to go ahead and use it. After 5 days, I go back to follow up.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question 1a) I first introduce myself to the patient and then let her know what I'm going to do including taking her history, examining her ears and her hearing. I also seek for permission from the head of the household by signing the consent form. I then go ahead with the plan I just talked about. If I examine and find discharge in her left ear, I wash, dry it and then put antibiotic drops for about one week. b) I take the history on the form with three copies. One remains in the book, another is taken to the health centre while the other is given to the patient. c)The important questions I ask the patient as I take their history include her name, age, the ear with a problem , if her hearing is okay, if she has tinnitus, discharge, itching, pain or if they have any problem besides ears. That's my reply to the questions.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	It's me Harriet. Greetings to you Catherine and well done. If I go to kirujja butoke and come across such a patient, I greet her then introduce myself to her. Once I'm done introducing myself, I ask her if she has any problems with her ears. If she says yes, I ask her if she would want to be examined. If she accepts, I write down her names, name of head of household, age, village and the ear with the problem. After that, I ask if she has any other problem besides ears. If she says no to that, I request her for some water to clean my hands. I then ask her again if I can examine her ears. If she accepts, I carefully take out my otoscope and examine her ears. In case I find her with that problem, I write it down and the particular ear I've found it. When I'm done with that, I check her hearing using the whispered voice test. If I find that her hearing is okay, I explain to her that I'm going to treat the ear with discharge. I then wash, dry the ear and give her antibiotic drops to use for five days, three drops three times a day. After the five days elapse, I go back to follow up. Also since she feels some pain, I encourage her to take some Panadol to reduce it. b) I take her history in the book you gave us that looks like a receipt book. It has three papers. The white one, pink and blue. I leave the blue one to confirm that I've worked on her and she can show it to anyone who may happen to have questions. c) I ask if she has any other condition or allergies. Some of them don't know what allergies are but you can explain to them. If they don't have, I go ahead. That's my reply.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

In case she got any treatment, what the reaction was. After I request for some water from her to clean my hands. I then examine her.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	First I introduce myself, then I give painkillers for 2 days. After that I washout with iodine, 1ml dissolved in 9mls of clean water. Then I dry mop. After that, antibiotics. 3 drops. I then write things down. The history, names, age, sex, the date, about the patients ears, pus, left vs. right ear. It is good to examine the patient and also for them to get treatment.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs. About seeing the other 33 year old lady in Kirujja Butoke I saw her and she has a hearing loss in the left ear and it also has pus, even pain, too much pain. The first question - I first ask for permission, then I examine the ear, then I was my hands, then I examine the ear inside and outside. I ask about allergies. If examine and find too much pain and pus I give them pain killers, then after 3 days I get pain killers. Then after washing my hands I examine. Then I write the history. I ask the names of the household head, the age, the date, the sex. After that I fill the remaining parts in the history book. How has the pain been, which ear has the problem. Then I ask about other illnesses. After seeing the outer ear is normal and the ear canal has pus, then after I examine then I write. I give her the form, put one at the health center, I keep one too. I forgot - I also need to get consent too. Part b - I guess I answered that in Part A. I also washout, with iodine and water. I keep washing and dry mopping until there is no pus then I give antibiotics. 3 drops, 3 times a day. 5-7 days.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks to all who have answered. The answers were as follows" A: A correct answer can either be ‘a hole behind the pinna’ or the correct term is a ‘post-auricular fistula’. A: They should mention that the ear drum is red and that they can see a white spot on the ear drum.Given the long history of hearing loss, pain and discharge and the hole behind the pinna they should suspect a potential cholesteatoma.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

I see her ear doesn't look well. When I look inside it has pus, and a perforation of the ear drum. That patient needs a washout. After washing out I give antibiotics. Then I do follow up.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Thanks Andrew. I would encourage our dear VHTs to keep referring to the booklet they were given.. It will make remembering easy, especially when they encounter anything suspicious in the community	case study	FALSE	SE	C&I
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning. This is the final question for this case. There are no 'right or wrong' answers here. We wish to just see your views and opinions. Q4a. There are long ques and waiting times at Mulago Hospital to be seen by ENT surgeons. Do you think this makes patients avoid going to the hospital even if they need to? What other reasons do people give for not going to a big hospital like Mulago? Q4b. In Uganda in 2009 there were 16 ENT surgeons. In 2015 this number increase to 35, however this number is much lower than a county such as South Africa where there were 246 ENT surgeons in 2015. Why do you think Uganda faces this situation? Q4c. How do you we can we link the limited number of ENT surgeons to the community better so that patients who need surgeons input can be seen and followed up?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	4a) The reason as to why people don't go to health centres is not because of long queues but it's because of the few health workers. You see even us when we go out in the community to treat ears, you can work on three people and feel fatigued already. Those health workers get tired, and that's why they're unable to work on some patients. Others ask for bribe. Another issue is, when ears just have discharge some people don't feel pain. In Uganda when someone doesn't feel pain it's hard for them to go to the doctor. That's my point. Also, our government doesn't mind much about health issues. It only cares about security issues. Actually the security budget is higher than that of health. If only the health budget was bigger, we would be so lucky.	case study	TRUE	none	none
SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Thank you very much Luke, about the idea you have given us. What do you say about the other two questions. I can't see the others? If you need clarification about the question I can do this. We need to get everyone's ideas about the questions.	case study	FALSE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If the government allocated more money to health, it implies nothing would be impossible. We would be having many health workers including those who treat ears. Seeta Nazigo currently has only two nurses.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	There is someone who interrupted me when I was talking, but if the government can help and put money into the health system, things will be possible. They can’t take people to other countries for treatment like China. For example, as you know, most of our doctors who are experts are abroad, meaning they aren't paying them enough money here. Or if not the government doesn't invest in the health sector. We could have ear services if the government cared and gave money to the health center.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This issue, we have to talk about it, so people can understand. If you look at Mukono and Kyunga district they only have 1 ENT doctor. That one doctor has to work on both districts. This means we still have a lot of problems. But our friend 'the owner of the hat' (meaning Musaveni) puts too much money in the military. Even if we don't have people attacking us. I request that at least if we had donors who can fund the health sector that would help us and have ENT specialists who are more than the number that we have. Because we can take an example of South Africa, they have 240 ENT doctors... we need the same. In South Africa people have more power than us. We can do the same as we are many	case study	TRUE	none	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Hi	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow people. My opinion on the first question is, I think money also prevents people from going to mulago. When someone hears about mulago, it implies spending. One wonders where one will get the money from because they don't have it. They know to see a doctor they need money as well as transport especially if they come from very far.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Another issue is, not everyone knows where Mulago is. You always hear elderly people claiming they're from Mulago yet it's not the one. Not knowing where the place is prevents people too.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	And the second question, Uganda has that problem because people don't have money to enrol their children in medical courses. It takes a lot of money. They are unable to do it because of the current financial constraints. I think that's why we have few ENT surgeons.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As for the last question, I think we can be able to do that if they reduce on the money needed to educate medical students. If it reduces, the parents can at least find ways of paying for their children. Now if we get 2000 parents in mukono district paying tuition for their children studying to become ENT specialists, the number increases which gets us to another step.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well done fellows. All you have talked about is right. We go there and find long lines and we don't even get the treatment. The doctors that have studied should be given opportunity to work in health centres. Some doctors are very old and have worked for years me. You go to seek treatment and they refuse to attend to you .Someone feels like they inherited the position and can only leave after death. You hear people have studied but have no jobs but we haven't been helped. I always see from our health centres here for example seeta Nazigo, you find a very old woman tired of giving birth and cannot even advise the pregnant women or take good care of them. I think they should give chance to the fresh ones. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you all for what you're doing. Those who have answered the questions, thanks for doing so. The first question; 4a) This is my view on what prevents our fellow people from getting to Mulago. The long distances from where we come from is one of them. Late coming on the side of the doctors even when patients are on time and quarrelling as soon as they reach. Pretending even when they arrive early, as if they ain't aware of why they are there. Too many patients waiting in line and some people take the opportunity to make money out of it by asking for something from people in order to get them to the doctors. Lastly, too much money asked from patients found with ear problems.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	4b) There's a shortage of doctors which worsens the situation. This is due to low payment for the doctors yet that course is so hard and expensive. Poor payment is generally responsible for the shortage. There's also shortage of equipments even when they have studied it. Another issue is people don't take ear problems seriously and others just don't have interest in studying certain things.  4c) What we can do to ensure such people are taken care of and followed up is  fulfilling the needs of the doctors health wise, personal needs and may be spiritually. Also, training VHTs to acquire more skills than what they already have for example we are now more skilled than our fellow VHTs who were left out. Extending health services nearer to communities for easy accessibility and for VHTs to follow them up easily. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. My name is Nora and this is my reply to the questions. 4a) The most important issue is lack of transport to facilitate one to and fro, and yet seeing the doctor requires money one may not have at the moment. I think hospitals that treat ears should have various branches for example in Mukono and other areas.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	4b) The government hasn't put effort in health issues. For example at seeta nazigo, the doctors are less than the patients but they were able to give us lots of soilders. The government hasn't helped the people at the grassroot in terms of health.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	4c) Now us VHTs who have been trained should put in more effort so that we help those who are unable to get to Mulago. If we are fully trained and able to do what is done there, we can always help the people in our communities who are unable to get there. We can easily access them, review their conditions and follow them up.	case study	TRUE	none	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Now I have a problem. There is a patient I have here. She is 80 yo lady, I gave her ear drops which she has been using. Today is the 5th day. I have washed the ear, but I have seen the wax is near the canal. It is so hard you can see it without putting the otoscope, so even if you put tissue papers they can't go in. I request for one of our helpers to come help me.	case study	FALSE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	4a) Long queues affect patients a lot and sometimes they go back without seeing the doctors. That makes them avoid going to hospitals. Other reasons that prevent them include; - Long distances and transport from Mulago; - Another issue is doctor from government health centers are rude to patients which scares them - Mulago is also expensive. 4b)  Uganda doesn't have enough ENT surgeons because the government gives them little money. Those who have studied are prompted to go abroad thus leading to a shortage. If the government gives them enough money, they will stay in their country.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Fellow VHTs, this is my reply to today's questions. 4a) What prevents patients from going to Mulago is because the president said it's no longer free of charge. They will continue using it to treat only very complicated diseases and someone has to pay some money. The amount I heard him mention was too high to be affordable by common man. Another issue is some people don't know where it's located and the queue is always long. Doctors always want some money which we may refer to as bribe. 4b)In 2009, we had few doctors because all doctors who have gone to school end up going abroad (brain drain). It is an important issue that is caused by low salary. 4c) Those doctors should be coming to health centres grade II, III and IV. They should give out their phone numbers. That's my reply to the questions. I remain Byamukama Gordon.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. The first reason as to why patients don't go to Mulago is because the doctors there lack morale. The government cares less about patients. A patient spends the whole day and night in line and still doesn't get seen. It has ever happened to me too. That's the first reason that stops them. Those with money always access them.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Second reason that stops them is government doctors who have so much interest in money and a lot of money. If they don't know who you're or have no attachment to anyone, you cannot access them. The rich get seen first even when you get in line before them. That also discourages people. If there's any way these doctors can change their attitude, we shall be glad.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The problem Uganda has in regards to the other question is it hasn't put effort in health issues. It instead focuses on useless things for example you find the government giving out money to ghettos yet people are dying of cholera.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings. I apologise to you - my phone ran out of battery. The power just came today. I got a bit of charge. Let me answer the question right now, even if my fellow VHTs have already answered. Let me also give my idea. What stops people from going to Mulago, my first question is 'Yes, people fail to go there if you don't have any relatives in Mulago or friends or contacts, if you don't have anyone you know you can be there for a week and no one will see you. You need to know someone to get treatment. Another is issue is these doctors - we need to be careful. If you go and they are in a rush they are tough. So even some need money, but the way you approach a doctor. But when you give the money, they receive the money. They look at you with a bad face. They are not compassionate. After that - people give up. It has left people to die.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This problem is there in Uganda (4B), because someone can care about his child and pay for school fees, the child goes to school. After studies the child can't find jobs and those people who are doing those jobs are so old. The parent sees they have lost money on the child. They think of another option - so they tell the child to go abroad to look for jobs. Those people abroad have more opportunities that here in Uganda. That is why they go abroad. So here we don't have experts. Another problem and cause, though our doctors work hard - they get little pay. They know the money is not enough. Even getting that money some of them don't get it on time. They worked for their money, but the administrators take months and months. They stay in self contained rooms which are costly, the need to buy food, pay bills. All this is hard if you don't get paid promptly. These are big sacrifices for them to make. If the conditions are so hard why can't such a doctor just go abroad where they are paid well.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Part C. What we can do. As we have got a chance of being trained as VHTs in the community we can help treat people. We need more training. We can then examine the patients. We should also go house to house looking for people. So it can be easy for the people to approach the doctors if they have a referral letter. So when the patient goes to the health center, they do not look like a new one. So they have a starting point. Another thing the government needs to start paying VHTs as we are trying to save lives. We need help as we need to do this work effectively. The government should add money to the health system instead of funding ministers and members of parliament. They are not doing much. There is another one, the government puts too much money in things thst do not matter. Education and health really matter - the teacher teaches the future doctor, the teacher teaches the future president, but if a teacher doesn't have a good life things for the future won't go so well. Thanks very much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks you very much. We lost charge as our phones ran out of battery. In Mulago people don't want to see you. You can go there when you are sick but you don't know where to start from . No one in there to guide you. You have to give money at each step of the way. That is why people don't go. Part B. We could have doctors, but they think in our country money has lost value, the money is so little that someone assumes that after going to school they will gain money. But they don't so they go abroad. That is why we don't have enough doctors. Part C. Those doctors should be brought to those small HCs like Mukono because it is near by. Leaving aside the issue of not seeing the doctors, someone from Makata has stayed their whole life here and can't navigate Kampala. This makes them anxious. So I suggest the doctors come closer to the people.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Catherine, this is Harriet. Good morning. Well done. There is something I want to clarify with you. When you told us when you are testing for hearing using whispered voice, about using the numbers you can get a child who is 2 years old or 3, they don't yet know how to speak. So you cant test their hearing using whispered voice. You could assume they have hearing loss, so instead I called their names, so when you call their name from one side they might then turn one side, and then not. Can that work or not?	case study	FALSE	C&I	SE

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After washing the ears of the patient and finding out the wax is still there I do the wash out again, if I found out it is still there after washing out again I refer the patient to the specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The advice I give her is to not insert anything in the ears, like they insert things in their ears then the wax sticks.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Please forgive me - what I have to do for that patient is a wash out, then dry mop, then I check again	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Todays question of the patient who had wax yesterday - I apply olive oil drops, 3 drops, 3 times a day, 5 days. Then after the 5 days I wash out with 9mls of H20 and 1 ml of iodine. I then dry mop those ears. If I do all that and the wax remains I put oil in the ears again and then wash out again after 5 days. If it remains again I refer the patient to a specialist. But the advice I give to that patient is not to insert sticks in to their ears - because this can affect the ear canal and ear drum. I also tell them that in case they get problems with their ears they should not self medicate. But they should see a health worker.	case study	TRUE	none	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Good morning fellow VHTs thank you for your answers. Regards to Madam Catherine thank you for helping us, same regards to Dr. Bryan.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my answer to todays question. I give that patient olive oil then I ask them to apply it three drops, three times a day for five days. After the 5 days I go back and do the washout. Then I dry mop.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I advise her not to miss a day of putting the olive oil in. Sometimes you give them the olive oil and they decide not to follow the instructions - they apply it just once a day. But I emphasise the instruction.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Now for the last question. If I see that the wax is still there after doing all that I make a referral to a specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is what I can do for yesterdays patient. I first explain to her that I am going to give her medicine called olive pil then I give it to them. People see olive oil actually as medicine. I tell her to apply 3 drops, 3 times a day for 5 days.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After the 5 days I ask her to come back to do the washout. Part B. The advice I can give her is to keep applying the olive oil drops and not to insert anything into the ears like sticks. I also tell her not to use any medicine that has not been given to her by ear specialists. Lastly I advise to her come back for follow up to see how she is doing.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Part C. If I do all that and then find out there is still wax I ask her to apply olive oil again for 5 days. Then we do the washout. If it is still there after that then I refer her to a specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none

If they tell me what to do I will let these people know so they go back knowing what will happen.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	That is a preauricular sinua. Catherine and Bryan can assess them but the main thing to see if  it is swollen and infected. It looks slightly swollen to me from the photo. If so they need to be urgently sent to Mukono HC 4 to have it drained and excised. Well done for sending the photo but please use the seeta nazigo group to send these messages	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Yesterdays question, for the patient who had wax in the ears. If I apply olive oil, I wash out, but the wax still remains. I do it again 2-3 times. If it still fails I refer to specialists.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and our bosses. Bryan, Catherine, Hannah. Greetings to you all. Thanks for the questions. I apologise for not replying to the question yesterday. I was so busy. But this is my reply to todays question. For that patient who has wax I explain to them that you have wax and I am going to do a washout and then she will have our medicine of olive oil. I give her the olive oil and show her how to apply it for the first time. Then I tell her to be doing it three times a day for five days. After doing that I ask her to come back to do a washout out. If she has been doing it properly we go ahead and do that washout and dry mopping.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	And after doing the dry mopping I check again using my otoscope. If I check and it is not clean yet I mix iodine and water again (1ml of iodine and 9ml of water). Then I wash out. I do it the second time then I check again.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If I check again and I can now see the ear canal I tell her she is now fine. That is how I have answered the first part. Second part. The advise I can give her is to use the olive oil the way she is supposed to. She has to be careful - that is drop by drop and not just pouring it in. Before giving it to her I first show her how to do it. After advising her on how to put it, I tell her not to miss any day. The other advise I can give her is not to insert anything she finds in her ears. Some people use match box sticks or anything they can to insert in their ears. I also advise her to keep her ears clean and to also be careful while showering so water doesn't go inside the ears. That's the advice I give her. Part C. If I apply the oil and do the washout but the wax still remains, I do it again. If I do it again and she still has the wax that means I refer to ENT specialists. I don't insist on continuing as I may damage her ears in the process so I refer to ear specialists. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Francesca thank you very much for your reply. But after doing all that and you still find she has the wax what would you do for her?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If I go back and find out the wax is still there. I repeat. I repeat the process of applying olive oil, three drops, three times a day. Then I wash out. If I go back and the wax is still there I refer the patient to an ENT specialist. In a bigger hospital.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After 5 days, I go back and do the washout the advice I can give her is not to insert anything in the ears. And not to use this medicine they hawk and sell in pharmacies. The ones they sell for both ears and eyes. They should only use medicine for health center three and us VHTs.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow VHTs thanks for the work you are doing. Now for yesterdays patient who had wax in the ears.

I do the washout after the five days, if I find there is still wax even after doing that, I refer to an ENT specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to the question - I have been very busy washing peoples ears. If I washout the patient and the wax still remains I ask him or her to apply the olive oil for two more days, after the two days I do the washout again using iodine and water. If I found the wax is still there after the second wash out and I advise her not to use sticks in the ears. I also advise her to put something in her ears when she is showering so water does not go in her ears. The reason I ask her to do that is to keep her ears clean and dry. That is my reply to the question.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Harriet you replied to the question very well thank you so much.	case study	FALSE	SE	C&I

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I had forgotten to explain that if the wax is too much you apply the olive oil, three drops, three times a day for 5 days. When you do the wash out you apply 9mls of water and 9mls of iodine. That is what I had forgotten to say. The advice I give her is to keep the ears clean and not let water go inside.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If that patient comes, I find they have wax and apply olive oil in their ears for 5 days then wash out I can't do anything more so I refer to a specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If I apply oil and the wax remains there, I apply it again. Sorry - I do the washout, dry mop, then I check again. If I find the wax is still there, I refer the patient to specialists.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs I am Isabella Kizza. Sorry for taking long to reply to the question I took a long time to reach home. If I find wax in the ears of the patient, I give them olive oil to apply - three drops, two times. For five days. Then I do follow up for the washout. The advise I can give her is to not insert any sticks into the ears. Because they may push the wax into the ear drum, causing more damage. So the advice I can give her is to at least use these tissues we use for washout.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to today's question. I refer that patient to a specialist, because his condition is hearing loss therefore he needs a hearing aid.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you all fellow VHTs for the work you're doing for the country. Thanks for attending the meeting today. This is my reply to the question. When I see that patient with a hearing loss, I refer him to a specialist and they give him a hearing aid. Have a good day.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings ladies and gentlemen and thanks for the work. I am called Isabella Kizza. I think that patient might have been affected while still young for example    with malaria or yellow fever. When I examine him and I find he has that problem, I refer him to a specialist. Thanks.	case study	TRUE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. This is my reply to today's question of the gentleman called Jamil from Seeta Nazigo, who after examination I discover has no problem with the ears apart from hearing loss. I think he has a problem with the inner part and therefore would refer him to specialists. Specialists say if the inner part is the problem he would need a hearing aid. That's what I would advise as Byamukama Gordon.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Welcome back from the meeting. Thanks for the work. It's me Patricia and this is my reply to today's question. That patient has a hearing loss so I would advise him to go and see ENT specialists for further examination. They would also advise him to get hearing aids to amplify sounds.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I refer that patient to ENT specialists.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to that question. When I examine that patient and I find he has that problem, It means the problem is with the inner ear. I therefore refer him to a specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for the work and welcome back from the meeting. Sorry I got there when you had already left. I had some commitments and a burial to attend but I had sent my bag. Concerning today's question, this is my reply. If the patient has a hearing loss but the otoscope shows no problem, I think his problem is to do with the inner ear. What I would do since I can't get to the inner ear is to refer him to specialists so they can advise him on what to do. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I have seen that patient, after seeing them and doing all that I send them to a specialist for further examination. The specialist can see what to do for that one.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Welcome back fellow members, thanks for today's work and that of the weekend. This is reply to today's question. First of all that patient has a hearing loss. What I would do in my capacity is to refer him to an ENT specialist and advising him to get hearing aids. That's what I can do about it.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my answer to the question of finding someone with a hearing loss but normal ears. I would refer him to specialists and let him know the charges. I would also tell him hearing aids cost between shs. 800,000 and 1,000,000. His condition is beyond my capacity.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After taking his history, checking his ears and finding no problem but fails the whispered test, it implies his condition is as a result of a middle ear infection. It means the bones of hearing have a problem. I cannot treat this patient but can only let him know he needs referral to a specialist for further examination. The specialist may tell him he needs either surgery or hearing aids. That's what I can do. Thanks.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. What are the causes of hearing loss??	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. Welcome back from yesterday's meeting and thanks for sharing your ideas. Forgive me for not attempting yesterday's question. It's because my phone's battery was dead. As for today's question that is a continuation of that of yesterday, hearing loss is sometimes inborn, sometimes it's as a result of sickness or accidents and many other problems. That's my view and thanks so much for listening to me. Have a good day VHTs. It's me your fellow VHT Johnson Matthew from Makata.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning members. Thanks for yesterday's work and that of today. Today's question requires us to give the causes of hearing loss. Personally, I will give you 4 or 5 causes. First of all, Mr. Jamil is 37 years but has had the problem since childhood which implies he must have suffered from severe malaria leading to that problem. Another cause is some medication like quinine. Formation of a baby in the womb is another one.  There are cases where some body parts are not fully developed and in this particular case it could be the ears. Also, the bone responsible for hearing could be having a hole leading to hearing loss. Fifth cause is Jamil might have been exposed to different sounds like loud places, loud music and welding workshops. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As for today's question concerning yesterday's gentleman, these are the causes of hearing loss I can give. First of all, diseases can affect ears causing hearing loss. Secondly, loud noises like bullet sounds can cause the problem too. Some people are born with abnormalities on the bones of hearing. Disabilities for example some teachers at schools slap students in the ears. In addition to that, violence in homes causing one partner to beat the other which may damage their ears and cause hearing loss. Using strong medicine like quinine. Lastly, old age though that gentleman is 37 which is not so old. That's my reply to today's question. I remain Gordon, VHT Makata.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to the question. Mr. Jamil might been affected as a result of the kind of treatment and care given to people. To be honest, quinine has damaged many people's ears. One uses it without taking enough drinks. Remember these are children and we have to take responsible for their wellbeing. Now, he might have been given quinine by the parents without water. He might also have been sickly as a child and the parents kept giving him quinine tablets. We know quinine tablets cause hearing loss. Secondly, the condition might have started while in the womb. The mother might have been alcoholic, had low immunity or wasn't eating certain nutrients when pregnant which help in the proper formation of the bones of hearing. It might also have been as a result of tough parents who slap their children causing the ear drum to burst. That's what I think. In Seeta there's a 14 year old kid who has a problem with hearing and the mother says quinine is the cause.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	First of all, I explain to Jamil that he ain't alone with that kind of problem. It might have been caused by growing up in a home where the children are slapped on the cheeks thus affecting the ears. Another cause could be suffering from malaria and being given quinine as treatment causing damage to the ears. Also, some people are born like that.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well done fellow VHTs. Sorry if my voice is so low but that's the loudest it can get because I fell sick. I explain to him the causes of hearing loss which include the  following. One can lose hearing while in their mother's womb. In case a pregnant woman falls sick and doesn't get treatment, for example from severe malaria, it affects the baby's brain. Some pregnant women use strong medicine for treatment. Others use alcoholic stuff, drugs like marijuana which affects the baby's brain causing hearing loss. Some people use head sets with loud sound which leads to bursting of the ear drum. Accidents also cause hearing loss for instance when one falls and the ears are affected. May be diseases from old age too and the treatment given thereafter like quinine. That's my reply.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellows and  this is my reply to the question. Factors that may cause hearing loss include the following. Some medication like quinine given to people with severe malaria. It is well known that quinine causes hearing loss. Secondly, some people are born like that. The ones referred to as deaf. Another issue may be a perforation because  Dr. Esther told us sometimes there are times when certain parts of the skin fail to come together to form a normal ear or the bones of hearing might have an abnormality. Another cause is one may have got an accident and not realize how bad it was. Others are exposed to loud sounds like those who work in factories, where as others use headsets with loud music yet their hearing may not have been good resulting into profound hearing loss.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for the work fellow VHTs. It's me Qiana and this is my reply to today's question. He might have been born with a hearing loss. Another cause could be use of some medication like quinine in a strong dose. Thirdly, he could have been slapped in the ears causing hearing loss. Thanks.	case study	TRUE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. Thanks for treating people and I love you all in Jesus Christ. I also thank Catherine and Bryan for the work they're doing. I thank Andrew for loving us. May God bless you all. This is my reply to today's question. Yesterday, we confirmed Jamil has a hearing loss. I think his mother could have fallen sick or got very stressed while pregnant. Some homes are violent and full of fights and when a pregnant woman goes through that, it affects the baby's brain. That man could also have fallen sick while still young and the parents didn't notice in time which worsened the ears. He might also have grown up around a place with loud sounds for example a stone quarry, bars, lodges or cinemas. His parents may have also communicated with him in a manner where they kept shouting. Other causes include;- Formation of his bones of hearing could be abnormal.-Medications we use and not just quinine but others too. -Use of certain things. One may have a minor problem but is advised to use lots of things which cause complications hence bringing infections.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs - thanks for yesterdays work and welcome back from the meeting. Forgive me for taking long to reply but my phone is having issues. I explain the patient that the cause of their hearing loss may be due to maternal factors during pregnancy, like taking alcohol, using herbs. Another reason could be ototoxic medicines, that could have cause the hearing loss.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHT and thanks for the work you are doing. I explain to the patient their hearing loss could be from flu or cough, and their parents were reluctant to take them to the hospital. Some of us look at those disease like they are simple but as a child they may effect you alot. He could have been taken to a clinic with doctors who are not well trained and given wrong medicines which cause hearing loss. Can also tell her that maybe some patients used herbs which worsened the condition and may have damaged the inner ear.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Since the person got the condition aged 5, it means he had hearing before that. I think an acquired cause of hearing loss could be exposure to loud sounds, overdosing on certain ototoxic medicines, or he might have had trauma to the ear. I then tell them in case they had seen ear specialists earlier on he may not have developed that condition.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I explain to that patient that they might have gotten malaria and they were given quinine causing the problem.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs, this is my reply to the question. Some of the causes of hearing loss include, use of quinine when someone is sick, some are naturally born with damage to their ears, that is what I have to say.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you the causes of hearing loss are: Medications (e.g. certain antibiotics cause hearing loss if the dose is too high like gentamycin), loud noises, old age (prebycusis), infections (measles and mumps) are some of the causes of hearing loss.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. This is todays question. You explain to him the causes of hearing loss. He asks you what treatment is available. What do you tell him?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs and thanks for the work. After explaining to Jamil the causes of hearing loss  and he asks the kind of treatment he needs, I would tell him he needs surgery by an ENT surgeon or hearing aids. I would also tell him before all that, it must have been confirmed by an audiologist. That's my reply for today's question. Thanks so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to today's question. After seeing Mr. Jamil and confirming his ears have no other problem besides hearing loss, I explain to him what could be used to help him. I let him know about hearing aids and their cost which is between shs. 800,000 and shs.1,000,000. I also direct him to ENT specialists who sell them instead of just buying from anywhere like someone purchasing groundnuts or a phone. And that the ENT specialist must confirm it first.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I explain to him that the treatment he can have may consist of surgery or hearing aids, but that can only be determined by a specialist. I direct him to that specialist.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After explaining the causes of hearing loss to Mr. Jamil, and he asks the treatment he needs, I would tell him he has to be seen by an ENT specialist for further examination. It is then determined whether he needs surgery or hearing aids but this is only done by an ENT specialist for example Dr. Tamale at Naggalama or Mulago. And may be our doctors from Mbarara. After explaining that to him, I advise him not to let himself get confused by people suggesting he uses herbal medicine. You know some people are fond of misleading others. He can only see medical doctors like the ones I've mentioned.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work and we thank God for keeping us alive till now. Now, this is my reply to today's question. After explaining to him the causes of hearing loss, I let him know that he needs a specialist for treatment because his condition is beyond our capacity. They may get him hearing aids or something else.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs and thanks for the work. I also tell Jamil that he may need surgery or hearing aids according to what the ENT specialist decides. I also encourage him not to lose hope.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The treatment or what I can do for Mr. Jamil after explaining to him the causes of hearing loss is to go and learn sign language. I also refer him to a specialist to continue helping him because his condition is beyond me. That's my advice.	case study	TRUE	none	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Thank you Karl, Luke, Dorothy, Gordon, Nora ne Isabella. All of your answers to the question are correct. After everyone has answered and it is 8pm I will give the answer and the procedures to follow .	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Thank you Jane	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well done fellow VHTs. The advise I would give to Mr. Jamil is to go to Mengo hospital because they also specialise in treating people ears. If he's unable to go there, he could then go to an ENT specialist. I would emphasize he shouldn't put herbal medicine which may end up worsening his condition. He can also go to bigger hospitals where they can do surgery or give him hearing aids. On that note, I would remind him to go with some money because the hearing aids are costly.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for all the work you've done today fellows. I would tell Mr. Jamil that his condition of hearing loss needs examination by ENT specialists or hearing aids to amplify sounds. That's what I can do.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing for the country. This is my reply to the question. After explaining to the patient that I cannot handle him, I refer him to ENT surgeons for re-examination. From that examination they can determine whether to carry out surgery on his ears or give him hearing aids.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Patricia, Edward ne Harriet thankyou very much for your responses.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The VHT should explain to him that to confirm the hearing loss they would need to refer him to a specialist called an audiologist who can test his hearing using special tests. Unfortunately however, there are not many audiologists in Uganda. The ones that are there are expensive and only in Kampala. There are some treatments for hearing loss like hearing aids and cochlear implants but these are also expensive. A hearing aid costs 6 million shillings for one, and the batteries need changing each week. Each battery costs 20,000 shillings. There are other things that the VHT can recommend. For young children with hearing loss they can go to special schools for the deaf for example. Here they can learn sign language and communicate. They can also give advice such as wearing ear protection to prevent hearing loss in the first place if they are exposed to loud noises in their job, or avoiding medicines which can cause hearing loss. The VHT can also explain to family members how to communicate with someone who struggles to hear properly. For example, speaking slowly, clearly and loudly. Not covering the mouth with the hand when talking to someone. Pointing to objects they are referring to. Being patient.If a baby has two parents who are deaf they should spend time with family members who are not deaf as this can otherwise affect their language development. Remember people who are deaf have normal intelligence.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks VHTs for the work you are doing for the country. After explaining to that gentleman his condition and then he asks for the treatment needed, I ask him to go to bigger hospital like Mulago where there are specialists. Those specialists can examine him again for hearing. I also explain to him those are the people who will give him treatment. I call those people ENT specialists. They can give him hearing aids or carry out surgery. That is the advice I can give him because at that point his condition is beyond me. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. Q4A. Have you met a lot of people in the community with hearing loss? What do you think are the main causes of hearing loss in Mukono? Q4B. Do community members get frustrated that there are no resources for treatment such as hearing aids? Q4C. How can you as VHTs improve the situation for the those with hearing loss if there are not many audiologists and hearing aids are expensive?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I will begin with the last question then answer the rest afterwards. Greetings to you all. If ENT specialists say that hearing aids are expensive, what I would do as a VHT is to counsel them. I would also politely advise them to go to schools that teach sign language. From there they can a lot of things. I know those people can even be more intelligent than us who are able to hear and speak properly.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question A. Yes, I meet a lot of deaf people in my community. The causes of hearing loss in Mukono include the following. Different kinds of treatment that happen to be bad especially for us the poor people at the grass root. You can get to the health centre and find no medication yet you have a very sick child with malaria and convulsions. You then seek advise from different people who tell you to buy quinine claiming it cured their sick children. One ends up giving those tablets to their children but forget to give them lots of water. I know quinine ain't bad but it becomes a problem when a parent fails to give water to the sick child all the time so it can dissolve it. The child ends up losing her hearing in the process. I call upon the government to bring back the waterly quinine because it's good for the children and doesn't cause hearing loss like the tablets. We were trained on how to self Medicate in Mukono, due to the situation at the health centre of inadequate medicine. Coartem is so expensive in clinics   yet quinine is cheaper. At shs. 500 you can get yourself two tablets but for coartem the first dose is at shs. 5000	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	In case people fail to go to the health centre because the treatment for ears ain't there or it's expensive yet they have no money, I counsel them and advise them to go and learn sign language. After that they will be fine and able to communicate with others. I can also look for those schools and direct them. They cannot feel sorry for themselves after that.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for yesterday's work. Good morning Miss Catherine, Mr. Bryan and the VHTs. Thanks for answering yesterday's question and the rest of the work you're doing. Question A. Yes, we meet so many deaf people. Just like the gentleman we talked about, there are so many causes of hearing loss for example sickness, use of strong medicine, accidents, getting beaten and poor treatment. Some people apply herbal medicine to their ears. Others ignore infections thinking they will cure by themselves. That's how I've answered the first question. It's me VHT Johnson Matthew.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question B. People get frustrated. First of all, they are poor and the government doesn't care so much about people at the grass root. You get to the health centre, for example I've personally moved to several government health facilities and haven't been helped at all. It discourages people and they decide to stay home whether their hearing is good or not. One ends up having so much on one's mind for instance poverty, business ain't operating smoothly, government health centres are not helping at all, imagine people like us! Where can one get the shs 3,000,000? You can't even raise it even if you decided to sell a plot of land. It frustrates us and we end up developing other diseases. That's my reply to the second part of the question.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question C. In case specialists come and I have people with hearing loss in my community, as a VHT I would come together with my fellows and ensure we counsel them. We can come up with a health camp like the one we had at seeta Nazigo health centre III and bring them together. Others may be having their relatives with jobs and money so they can be helped. That's my only suggestion. Counselling them because we don't have money to give them neither are we ENT specialists. Only thing we can do is advising them and counselling them whenever that camp is conducted. Those who can access help, well and good but those who are not able to can be helped that way. That's my reply to the third question. It's me VHT Johnson Matthew. Have a good day our health workers who are present and the rest of the VHTs.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As VHT Gordon, this is my reply to today's question. The biggest cause of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono are the machines used in stone quarrying. They are so loud and it's a big problem because we have so many of them in Mukono. They   burst people's ears causing hearing loss.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question B. People are discouraged when there's no treatment for hearing loss. Hearing aids are so expensive yet the disease is so rampant amongst the poor. People are unable to purchase them which is a big problem. I heard that they cost between shs. 700,000 and shs. 3,000,000. Some of our patients here in Makata were once told the same thing.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As VHTs, what we can do for those people is to ask the government to cooperate with developed countries in order to reduce the price of hearing aids. That's all we can do as VHTs including me Gordon. Have a good day, I remain Gordon.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Some of the causes of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono include; sickness, self medication, illness, neglecting ear problems, herbal medicines, some are born like that, wrong medicines, loud noises. Part B: People don't know where to go or are too poor to afford to see a doctor. Part C: As a VHT I can continue to sensitise them on not neglecting diseases; avoiding things that might be harmful to the ears; how to take good care of the ear.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I greet you all fellow members and thanks for the work. Today's question has 3 parts. Question A. These are my opinions on the causes of hearing loss in Mukono. So many factories especially loud ones lead to producing of children with hearing loss. So many stone quarries that are loud as well also cause hearing loss. Medication given in health centres. Parents neglecting sick children when the diseases are still in their early stages like malaria, measles also causes hearing loss.B. Yes, people get frustrated. Treatment for hearing loss is very expensive especially hearing aids. Besides being expensive, people are not aware of where to find them. They may end up buying fake ones after spending a lot of money on them. They are not even sure of the amount of money they cost. In addition to that, they also need special care like phones. One may be unable to afford batteries. The machines used to test hearing loss are so rare. You will get to the health centre and not find them yet the distance travelled to get there might have been long. Poverty amongst people really discourages them.C. As a VHT, what I can do is to advise pregnant women to get maternal services right from when they find out they are pregnant till when they give birth. They should also take good care of their babies and not to neglect any disease. They should also spend less time in loud places like the factories we talked about and discotheques which may affect their ears. Lastly is to request the government to put restrictions on loud places so that they can reduce on the sound they produce. If such restrictions are put in place, our people won't be so much affected. Those are my opinions.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Sorry I was unable to answer yesterday's question because my phone battery was dead. This is my reply to the causes of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono. Most of the time people get ear infections with no where to go for treatment so they resort to using herbal medicine. Someone spends 30 years with no treatment because they have no idea where to find the ENT specialists. B. Yes, people get discouraged because they haven't received any treatment and have no money to buy hearing aids. C. What I can do for such people is to counsel them and let them know they ain't alone.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Apologies for taking long to reply to the question. Thanks for yesterday's work. Miss Catherine and Bryan, I send my regards to you. Thanks for serving and loving us. This is my reply to today's question. The biggest cause of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono is sickness like severe malaria especially amongst children. You decide to go to the health centre, line up till 3pm and by the time they get to you the child is worse. They give you quinine tablets to give to them but you're too poor to afford drinks so in the process, the child ends up losing their hearing.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	B. People are frustrated because of poverty. It all goes back to poverty. People are asked to buy the hearing aids but they give up because they don't have money. If only the government puts more emphasis on health issues for example by constructing more facilities where people can buy hearing aids, they may cost way cheaper than they do now. It hasn't put any effort in health but has instead done so in security.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	C. For such people, I can only counsel them because it's all I can do. All of us VHTs cannot do much about that. You can ask them if they have their people who can help them and if they say no, you go ahead and counsel them so they don't feel stressed. My regards to you all fellow VHTs. I remain Nora, seeta Nazigo.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	B.As VHTs, we should keep teaching people how to take good care of their ears because hearing aids are expensive and learning sign language requires money too. They should therefore take care of their ears and see doctors as soon as they discover they  have any problem with them.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	C. As VHTs, it's our responsibility to explain to and sensitise people on how to take good care of their ears. It's important not to give up until we are sure they know and understand what to do. We should also sensitize them on some of the myths in communities like buzzing sounds that are mistaken for someone being talked about, itching that implies one has syphilis and others. Since our doctor has discovered many issues of hearing loss, he probably has something he can do about it. Hearing aids are expensive but he can find a way to help. When he goes back, he can find ways or else in Uganda we are likely to have many deaf people. May be government health centres should also sensitize people on the diseases they treat including ears.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all my fellow VHTs. Sorry for taking long but my phone had got issues. The question requires us to give the causes of hearing loss amongst people in Mukono. In 1983, there was an outbreak of measles amongst children. They were given strong medication which might have caused hearing loss. Self medication also causes hearing loss and using sticks when ears itch. Some may be born that way. In Mukono, we have stone quarrys that also cause hearing loss.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	B. People are frustrated because they don't know where  to go. Poverty also discourages them and may be ignorant.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As a VHT, what I can do is to sensitize them on what to do and ask them to avoid things that may affect their ears.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all and this is my reply to the question.A. The biggest cause of hearing loss in Mukono district is sickness which affects their bodies. Medication causes the problem too. Inserting sticks in their ears to remove wax and stone quarries also cause hearing loss. B. Yes, people are discouraged when there are no hearing aids or if they're unable to afford them. C. As VHTs, what we can do is to advise people on how to prevent ear problems that can cause hearing loss. I also call upon the government to offer free treatment for people with hearing loss or to reduce on the tax of hearing aids during their importation to Uganda so they are affordable. They should also deploy more ENT specialists in government health centres. That's my reply to today's questions. Thanks so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I greet you all fellow VHTs. Thanks for today's work, everything you're doing and for answering the questions. This is my reply as well to today's questions. A. What causes hearing loss in Mukono is chaos. People are always rioting, bullets are being shot, so much noise, factories are many, stone quarries all of which cause hearing loss. Another issue is people's mindset of being bewitched all the time. It makes them think they will never get fine. A baby is born with a hearing loss, but the parents don't mind about it and thereafter claim someone bewitched them when pregnant or their child. Thirdly, sometimes when we give birth to babies we don't take responsibility to check their hearing yet if we do it earlier the problem can easily be detected.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	B. Yes, it frustrates people. First of all hearing aids are very expensive, and only a few people are aware of them besides us who got a chance to be trained. Honestly speaking I've only come across one person with them in my whole village. Unfortunately they got stolen. Out of ignorance, one decides to give up after all they may not be having the money. Secondly, the batteries are expensive. For someone to spend shs.20,000 yet eats food without sauce and cannot afford soap may not be possible.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	C. What I can do for deaf people as a VHT include the following. First of all those people need to be shown love. Someone like me who is able to hear needs to do the few signs I know happily, show them that I care and love them and that I am not special because they need company. I can also teach these people things they do not know like how to keep their ears clean and free from infections much as they are deaf. I also teach them spiritual things. God created people and all is possible before Him. He used to heal the blind, deaf and lame people. I can therefore advise them to go and see pastors who are not fake. There are those who have believed with faith and got their hearing back after prayers. That's how I've answered those questions. May God bless you. Thanks Catherine, Bryan, Andrew and my fellow VHTs.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Thank you very much Harriet for your opinion. In case you find anyone with hearing loss please help them the way you told us.	case study	TRUE	none	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	VHTs we are very grateful for all your replies this week. All of you have given very good views. Please continue to share ideas and help people with hearing loss in your communities in the ways you have mentioned. We are done with the questions for this week. Have a good night.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question 2. In case I find those people in my community, I counsel them and tell them they are not alone. I also tell them there are organisations which bring together the deaf people. I advise them that there are organisations that empower deaf people with technical skills in carpentry and tailoring using sign language. We have encountered such people in society and they are usually very good. That is the advise I can give there are also schools that can teach deaf people using sign language.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks all VHTs for today work thanks for replying to todays case. Thanks you for Catherine and Bryan for the work you are doing for us. The one greeting you is Qiana Kigwana. This is how I reply my first question. In Mukono the reason why we have people with hearing problems is because some parents when they get pregnant they don't want to go to hospitals for check up - then the kids get ill. Some used to go to private shops and buy quinine and swallow - yet malaria is too much. So after taking the quinine they take too much of it so by the moment that they produce that child they come out with a hearing issue. Another thing someone can produce a child who hears very well, but sometimes the child gets sick but gets too much malaria then they get treatment with quinine then the quinine becomes too much because my inlaws child has this issue. They always advise them to use quinine which is why the child does not hear, yet the child was good but these days we use sign language. Now he is in S1, but he was produced when he was normal but the problem was quinine. Quinine was the medicine every just took without even knowing if it was the right one. Even pregnant women. But because when pregnant women go to hospitals they get a different drug.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	My third question - after seeing that the equipment is expensive I encourage them and advise them that there are technical schools, where they can go and learn. Because even the teachers who teach them use sign language. So that way they can develop themselves instead of staying the same when they don't know anything. Yet in those technical schools some do craft work, weaving baskets. They also teach them as people who hear. They also have a chance and an opportunity because those people train in construction, carpentry sand many more. They can be trained in sign language - a bit like the blind with braille. Because the blind can't see but they have special equipment. So the same applies to the deaf. There are many things they can use to help them. Though they can't hear they can see what can be done. So they can see each sign they are taught.	case study	TRUE	none	none

QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Greetings members. I have an issue. I have two children. The mother told me in the first 3 months the child had pus in the ear - they treated it, it got normal. Then 6 months later it came back. But right now the child is 4 years and the pus has come back. Right now the child does not have pus - but if you stand at the back of the child the child does not hear. So instead you have to stand in front of the child otherwise the child will not hear you. But behind they do not hear. So I need help about this child. I also have another one who is the elder of this one - 6 years old. They are girls. They also told me they have a similar problem - they used to have pus, the mum put warm water and would drain it from the ear which means the child never got antibiotics.  I examined and didn't see any pus but wax and itching. So I need your advice what can I do? Bryan and Catherine I need your advice as I fill the forms - because if they need antibiotics I don't have them right now. But I will do what is possible and let you know. Thank you so much.	case study	FALSE	C&I	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Edward what I think. The first thing you can do, get your camera and take photos of the child, then send it to us for both kids. The second one, you have to wash her ear out, remove the wax, but what is best is to take photos of both kids and send them to us. Remember though don't get their faces in it - just the ears for the reasons of consent.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Another thing; remind them in May that there will be an ear camp at Seeta Nazigo. The doctors are coming - ENT. Also I think let the patients give you their phone number, the mum. Then you call her once we know the date.	case study	FALSE	SE	none

QA-QA	QA	QA	Thank you Edward, what I can say, the ear with wax needs olive oil and that with pain I think the person needs pain killers and we see how he will be. That is my idea.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hello VHTs. Thank you for all of your hard work. This case is designed around the feedback you have been providing us. It concerns itching ears. You go to see a patient in Makata called Annette who is 50 years old. She is complaining of both ears itching. You take a history and examine her. She has been bothered by itching in her ears for the last 5 months. She has no pus and no wax in her ears. When you look inside the ear with your otoscope it looks normal.  Q1. What do you think the causes of ear itching could be?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As Luke this is my reply to the question. After examining Annette and taking her history, and realising that her only problem is itching but the inside is normal, I honestly don't know what to do. I don't know what causes the itching since there's neither wax nor pus. I would like you to tell me and I have always been asking the cause. So, I don't know.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I have seen today's question of a lady called Annette who has a problem of ears itching for 5months. I think the cause is this person might have used sticks to clean her ears. These sticks can affect the ear canal. Also, the skin of the ear canal might be having an infection. That infection may cause the itching. I would also say wax but after examining it shows there's no wax so I think it's one of those two. Either she used sticks in her ears or the skin of her ear canal has an infection. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	It's me Jane. I think the problem is in the inner ear and I refer her to specialists.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning my brothers and sisters. Thanks for the work you're doing. We thank God for the rain today. Greetings Catherine and Bryan. How are you Andrew? How's everything? Thank God who has kept you while there. I have seen today's question and this is my reply. If I examine and find no problem like wax, pus or even a hole, it means the skin has an infection. Another reason is some people have allergies and may not be aware. Ears react faster than any other body part. That's my reply. It's either allergy or a skin infection. Rubbing them to ease the itching is also another one. The more someone does it, the more it itches. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs everywhere in our villages. I am Isabella Kizza. When I check the 50 year old lady called Annette and find no problem besides itching for 5 months, I first advise her not to use sticks to ease the itching. I can also refer her to specialists.

SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Other VHTs what do you think causes itching in the ear?	case study	FALSE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. How was your night? This is what I have to say. When I go to Makata and find a 50 year old lady called Annette with itching in the ears, and I take her history but on examining I find nothing like pus or wax in her ears, what I have to say doesn't differ from what others have already said or will say. I have three reasons. First of all, Annette is now old and her age is prone to diseases. Secondly, she might be having germs in her body. Thirdly, she might be using some medicine she is allergic to. I think those reasons could be causing itching in Annette's ears. May be another reason is she could be having wounds that we are unable to see. By the time she inserts sticks, it means the finger is too short to reach the inside. There could be wounds that are still not so visible. It's just like a swelling that itches but only becomes a wound after it bursts. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Isabella. But before that, what do you tell the patient what causes itching in the ear?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Ok Edward, thanks.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs. This is my reply to that question. When I look inside the ear and see no pus or wax but the lady experiences itching, there could be germs. May be she had a shower and water went in her ears  and now there are germs. Her condition needs specialists.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Now, given Annette's condition the 50 year old lady from Makata, this is what I think could be the cause of her ears itching. Some people have skin diseases but because they don't feel pain, they don't bother treating them. Sometimes you find a child or adult with ringworms in the head, another with dandruff yet another may not be having any. She may be having a skin disease in the hair that may be affecting the ears when she tries to scratch it. Secondly, she may have used something that shouldn't be used in the ears like sticks, dirty water, medicine and others. I think that's what causes ears to itch.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As Qiana this is what I do for an ear with wax. I apply olive oil 3drops, 3times a day for 5 days. After that I washout.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	You explain to her that the inside of the ear looks normal. She asks you for treatment. She insists you give her antibiotic ear drops. What do you tell her?  What treatment do you give her?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. As Luke, I let Annette know that I won't give her antibiotics because they could damage her ears. I advise her to keep them clean and to also get checked for any skin infections. That's how I explain to her. May be the issue of age too but we were told it's usually 60years and above not 50. I ensure she's satisfied with my explanation about the antibiotic drops being dangerous to her ears that seem normal before I leave her home. All white medicines have effects including Panadol which may damage your liver if taken in over dose. On that note I ask her to be patient and visit the health centre for examination of any skin infections. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. I would like to thank you for all the work you're doing and for replying to the questions. Regards to you madam Catherine. I have been lost because my phone got a problem so my messages were not getting delivered and I couldn't receive yours either. I also had my tooth removed in the last week of March which caused a swelling and so much pain. I got a specialist who repaired my phone and now I am back online. This is my reply to yesterday's question but please forgive me for the delay. I cannot do anything for the patient but rather refer her to specialists for help.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Now for today's question of Annette asking for treatment for her itching ears, I personally refer her to the health centre to get pain killers. They can also examine her and if they have no medicine for her problem, they can write it down for her to get it from any pharmacy. If she insists on getting antibiotics I explain to her that I examined her ears and there's nothing like pus or perforations. Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication. I strengthen her and advise her to go to the health centre for medicine that can stop that itching. In case they don't have it, she can get it from the pharmacy after them writing it down. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I also greet you VHTs; so for todays question what I do for Mrs. Annette I don’t give antibiotics even if they want them so much. I don’t give them and explain why I am not giving them antibiotics. I explain to her I examine the ears when they are normal so she does not need to use the antibiotics. I also don't see any kind of treatment that needs to be given to her as she only has itching in the ear. Itching in the ear does not have medicine. But what I can tell her, is that it could be because of too much heat, wax and bacteria like fungus. So I tell her to go to the hospital for more examination. That is where she can get treatment from.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning members. Thanks for the work we have started doing today. That lady Annette, we discovered yesterday she has itching in the ear, so we were told that sometimes itching comes because of some bacteria in the body. But in all situations there is no way that antibiotics are recommended for this. So if they are so hard on me and want antibiotics I refer them to the specialist. Then the specialist will assist them to reduce pain from itching. Then also to get some tablets for deworming for kids. They might have worms in the body. Another thing I can do, not to make her angry I just ignore her and refer her to the people who know more than me. Then I inform her - let those people examine you but if they find a problem in you I will see if you can get medicine but right now I don't have the medicine for you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings all of you. My name is Gordon. So when I approach this lady called Annette from Makata who wants antibiotics for itching in the ear, when the ears have no problem, just itching. So I don’t give antibiotics to that lady. I tell her antibiotics do not work for itching I make a referral for her to go to another hospital so they can examine and tell her what the issue is. Because yesterday I saw that itching might be because of itching, too much heat in the ear canal and too much wax like we saw yesterday so there is nothing I can give her. I refer her to a big hospital because I don't have any treatment for itching. That is my view. I am Gordon.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my fellow VHTs,  sorry Hadjjah but god cares. That lady Annette, after examining her knowing she does not have any problem, but she insists to be given the antibiotics, I explain to her you do not need the antibiotics because first of all, there is no wound, no pus. I inform some of the causes of itching might be trying to scratch your ear using sharp objects, the more you itch it with something it creates more itching. But if I refer her to the specialists to examine her she might be having the other bacterias we saw yesterday. Those which affect the ear, maybe some allergies. Thanks so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs. Thanks for todays work and also replying to the questions. The reason you have not been hearing me - my charger got an issue, so I did not have anywhere to charge from. That is why you did not hear from me. For todays case, this is how I reply. What I advise Mrs. Annette. I don't give her antibiotics, antibiotics are only given to people with pus in the ear and perfs. But those who have itching aren't given antibiotics. I also advise her to keep her ears clean, if it has wax, use olive oil. So that we can soften the wax and washout. But if the itching goes on I refer the lady to the hospital.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs, thanks for the work you are doing and for those who have replied to the questions thank you. My answers are not also different from the others. About that lady called Annette from Makata, about her problem of itching, the truth is that some patients want to pretend they know more than us so they force you to do things that can harm themselves. According to me - if she has asked me to do that and when I examine there is not indication for antibiotics, I don't give her them. Because if you put the medicine in the body it becomes poison if there is no need for it. So I cant give someone something which is going to cause harm. So I tell her the truth - this medicine can't be given to you, so I refer her to the specialists to understand what causes the itching.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs - thanks for the work. That lady Annette, if she insists for me to give her antibiotics, I tell her that the antibiotics will cause you problems. This illness is not for antibiotics. But if you had discharge from the ear like pus then you can use antibiotics. So what I advise her, I tell her to go to the hospital. I tell her to go to SN HCIII. They can examine her and give her treatment as I don't have any for itching.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	That lady Annette, when I examine her ear and doesn't have pus or a hole but itching I tell her not to use sticks to clean her ears.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well done VHTs; I am sorry I am having network issues with my phone. I sent my reply but it delays to send. I am sorry. For todays case my answer is this - that lady Annette when I examine it and it has no wax, pus, hole but has itching I tell her that there might be fungus making the ear itch. In the field some people call you, you examine them but just have itching. Others have wax, but with itching in the ear. And others have normal ear drums but itching in the ear. I also remember we talked about this issue and we said people are always asking you for treatment. So for us we say Bryan, Catherine and Dr, Andrew give us the right answer and give us the medicine that can heal the itching in the ear. There is a man I know - his ear has things like dust which also brings itching in the ear. Even if they use sticks to clean their ears. But they can't use the sticks if the ears are not itching. Which means they have an issue with their ears. Even me I am also one of them. Before I was washed out it also used to itch me sometimes - that is why someone can try to insert something in the ear which can damage it. So we don't have a perfect answer; I just refer them to the specialist so they can be assessed properly. That is my view - have a good night. I have an issue with the network	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

I have seen todays question of the 50 year old woman who has a problem with itching but the ears are normal inside. Here yesterday we said some of the causes are old age, not cleaning it enough. Since the lady has no wax, I will give her olive oil. They say she needs to apply it two or three times a day. For 3-5 days. After that she goes back to the VHT for a washout. The itching is caused my so many things, infections, heat. Ok that is what I have to say. You apply oil. She might have used sticks. Thanks very much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

You give them olive oil drops or the steroid drops in case itching is too much and the skin of the ear canal is red. You explain that the steroid drops can make the skin red. Then you tell them that they should not use sticks, cotton, or anything else to rub the ears. You explain to them why, the reason why it may affect the ear canal or damage it. Goodnight and lets wait for tomorrows question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After advising her to purchase steroid ear drops you then go back to see how she is two weeks later. She has not purchase the ear drops but instead asks you to get them for her freely. What can you do in this situation? Do you think people should be expected to pay for their own treatment? If so, why?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. My regards to you Catherine and Bryan. This is my reply to todays question. If that lady comes and she did not buy the medicine but she wants me to get it for her instead, I tell her I can't afford it but she should try raise the money herself in order to improve herself. People shouldn't be forced to buy their own medicines, but because of their situation they have to buy it as they need it.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to todays question - when I go back after 2 weeks and she didn't buy the medicine I tell her she didn't do a good thing because she is sick and she needs to improve her health. The more you delay the more money it costs. When you treat it earlier, you spend less money and you get cured very fast.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	For the second question - people are supposed to buy medicine because the government health centres don't have medicine for complicated disease. The medicine in gvmt hc is for malaria. So when you have such a disease you need to buy your own. The government does not give it to our health centres so you just have to buy it.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Lastly they need to buy the medicine because it is their health - there are so many diseases affecting the community. If not attended to it might get worse. My regards to you all fellow VHTs in your villages. Thanks for serving the country. May god bless you as you tend to the patients.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs, if I go back and find that she didn't buy the medicine and she asks for money from me to buy it I tell her we are just volunteers. We offer services to ensure you ae ok and don't get paid anything. I request her to go get money elsewhere and buy the medicine because your life is in your own hands. If you can't afford medicine, you are badly off and your going die. I request you to help yourself, get that medicine, as I personally don't have medicine to give. That is what I tell that person, but in a good way.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs - thanks for the work. This is my reply to todays question. If I go back to her place and find that she didn't buy the medicine, and she then expects me to give it to her I can't afford it. I cannot afford the medicine, because the government can't afford it. So if the government can't afford it, how am I , a VHT meant to afford it? I tell her to do whatever it takes to get the money for the medicine in order to have good ears. I also tell her that if she delays there may be further damage to the ears and she may be unable to communicate to others.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	You asked us should people buy medicine for themselves. My view is yes. People should buy it for themselves because the medicine might be so expensive so if we buy for them we might fail. Yet it is so bad to start something and we do not finish it so I think they should buy the medicine for themselves. Why? Me I want them to buy it for themselves cos people will be more careful. We are careless me inclusive. For example you give them free olive oil to put in the ears, but you go there and try to wash out the ear so when they buy it they will take the responsibility to make sure their money is not wasted. When we give it for free they can drop it on the road side even when they have not finished their doses. They throw the medicine - if we give for free they won't take it seriously. So I want them to buy it for themselves. That way they will be more responsible. Another thing when the person buys his or her own medicine it is properly prescribed and the money. So the person can also tell a friend that I bought the medicine for myself, it is not from the government or free of charge.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I refer her to the health centre of seeta nazigo to get treatment if she doesn't have anyone to buy her the medicine.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Question 2. When I find those people in my community, I encourage them and tell them they ain't alone with hearing problems. I also advise them that there are organizations that empower deaf people with technical skills in carpentry and tailoring using sign language. We have encountered such people in society and they are usually very good. That's the advise I can give. There are also schools that teach deaf people using sign language.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for today's work fellow VHTs and for answering the questions. Thanks Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. It's me Qiana and this is my reply to the first question. The reason as to why there are so many deaf people in Mukono district is because of the parents. They would get pregnant and refuse to go to the health centre. In case they fell sick, they always bought quinine and would swallow an overdose. At the time of birth, they would end up producing deaf children. Others would give birth to normal children but would treat children with quinine. My in-law's child is a victim. He had cerebral malaria and they treated him with quinine. He's now  deaf in senior one but uses sign language. Quinine was so common back in the days. Pregnant women were not allowed to use it though and were given fansidar instead. That's the reason as to why there are many deaf people. Whoever used quinine fell victim. Well done fellow VHTs. Forgive me my network is not good but I've replied to the question. As for today's question, in case I check in the 50 year old lady's ears and find nothing yet they itch, it means there are germs. We talked about that issue and were wondering the cause because a lot of people ask us. We said Catherine, Bryan and Andrew should give us the answer and the treatment for it. I know a man who has ash coming out of the ears and it also causes itching. The reason as to why they insert sticks in the ears is to ease the itching. I also had issues with mine before the washout and used to insert in sticks. Such sticks may damage the inner ear. I can only refer such a patient to specialists. That's my reply but the network is not good.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I greet you in the name of Jesus. My suggestions about this lady Annette; when I go there when she didn't buy the medicine, my job is to talk with her very well because she was supposed to buy the medicine to help her get out of the problem. So I tell her to look for all ways of buying that medicine. Then I show her the benefit of treating the illness, so I tell her if you delay the illness will get worse, treatment will become expensive. So I beg you to try as much as possible and buy the medicine. That is my suggestion.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Another question; you said what can you do in such a situation? Even though we are VHTs, we are counsellors too. The work of the counsellor is to share ideas so that that person can help herself to get out of the issue. The best idea is to talk with them very well and come up with a solutation, where to get the medicine so that they can get the treatment.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Another question was saying do you think people should buy medicines for themselves; it is true. The first reason is that in Uganda now there is a problem with medicine - it doesn't care about health. So someone has to buy medicine for themselves. Another thing is that when you use your money to buy medicine you use it as directed. But in most cases people become careless because they got it for free. They did not put any money from their pockets in - but if they use their money they can do things right. So I think people should buy medicine according to the way Uganda is. Even in Mulago nothing is free. That is my suggestion have a good day.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning our coordinators - Bryan, Andrew and Catherine. Thanks be to God for keeping you - I also greet all our brothers and sisters for keeping you. Here are my answers. When I go to Annette's place, and find out she didn't buy the medicine that she was told to buy to stop itching the truth is when she asks me to buy it for her, I sit down with her then I explain to her that I examined you, I told you the issue, I told you what to do. So in that case I don't have the medicine. We are also not given such medicine from our coordinators so I request you to care about yourself and look for all possible ways if you don't have money - ask from your family members or friends such that they can help you to get that medicine; because when you delay the situation can get worse. The itching won't stop on the outer ear. It will also affect the inner part. When the illness gets worse - it gets expensive to treat. So I advise her to continue to look for ways to buy the medicine.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The next part - this is how I reply. The truth is, because we give a tax on everything we buy as you see todays government it shouldn't be that we buy medicine for ourselves because on everything - even the smallest thing we buy - we are taxed. So because we people who give tax we need the government to give us free medicine. But because our government has many loop holes people are forced to buy medicine for themselves. If you wait to demonstrate and protest, most of us will die by the time they decide to provide it. But we pay tax, and the tax could be use to buy medicine to help the people. In that situation because the government don't do it in time people have to buy medicine for themselves.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Another part, which says should people buy their own medicines? The truth is when someone doesn't hustle to get something, they don't appreciate the value of that item. But for a person who has worked hard to get money to get something or to get money a person will always be so careful about how to use that money. So the person will say I worked hard for this money so I can't play around. But if a person doesn't know where something came from they don't take any care or doesn't take any responsibility. Another thing - people who give you free medicine care about your life more than you. If you give it free its like you are forcing things on them - so let them love their live first. That is why they have to buy the medicine themselves so they know what it is like to go through to get the money. They need to know the cost of the medicine - if they don't know the cost they will use it poorly. If they know it is 100,000 they will use it wisely.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I greet you my fellow VHTs. As we were all aware, steroid drops can help itching in ears. So Annette, I would advise her buy that medicine and after 1 week when I go back and find she didn't buy the medicine and asks to get the medicine for free. I tell her I can't do that for free. Instead she has to look for money so that she can get the medicine. What I inform her, they wrote the medicine but it's not there at the health centre so we have to buy it and I also think people should buy medicine for themselves because it is their life and the government can't manage to treat 40 million people. It doesn't have the ability to get that medicine. That is why you see the medicine at the health centre - for example you see it at the health centre for 3 months doesn't even last for a month at the health centre. So that is what causes people to get upset. They just examine them and write them a script for a medicine to be bought elsewhere. So I tell her you go buy that medicine and also people have to care about their life. They shouldn't wait for the government, because the government is you and me. It doesn't have that ability - that is why private hospitals or pharmacies are so many in the country to help the government. We have to pay some money so people should know life is more important. They should also take into consideration that when they get money, put some aside for treatment in case they fall sick, That is my suggestion for today.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my fellow VHTs thanks for the work your doing - Andrew, Bryan Catherine. About todays case that lady Annette about the medicine they directed her to buy - the steroid drops. If she was directed to buy the medicine and we find out she didn’t buy it either because she didn't have money or wants it for free I think we counsel her. She shouldn't take her life for granted. Because the illness will become greater. So I sit with her. I advise her to look for the money in all ways so she can go buy that medicine. Not every medicine is there in the government health centres. We always find whenever we go to government health centres we don't find certain medicines so we have to go to private pharmacies. So I sit with her and advise her with counselling. The next question,  I say yes, Buying medicine isn't bad because there is some medicine that is so expensive that even the government can't give it to everyone in Uganda. Therefore buying medicine is not bad - it is a responsibility for a person who is sick to take care or her life and to use the medicine and not waste it. By working hard, getting money they don't waste it.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings members thanks for todays work. Those in pain - I pray you are healed. The question was saying after telling Annette, the situation is like this - based on her age. She is in her 50s - her source of income might be low. If I have money I can buy medicine for her. Then I inform her I don't have enough but I bought you the first dose. Another thing I do - I refer her to the hospital to see that she gets the medicine. The next question said, do you think ppl should buys medicines for themselves, I say yes because they need to care about themselves before the illness gets worse. Another thing - it helps them to be responsible for their lives. Because if they keep waiting for something for free, they don't care enough. Yet, the illness gets worse. Another thing, is because in the government hospitals the medicine is not there. When you reach there they tel you to buy the medicine yourself. But on the other side, it is in the governments responsibility to protect and look after its people. Another thing is that people shouldn't buy medicine for themselves because they pay tax.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs thanks for the work - my answer for todays question, for what I tell her is I don't have the medicine. I can't give it out. When she is not able to buy the medicine - if I have sme money I try help her. But when I also don’t have, I say, because of your life try as hard as possible to ask from your friends or relatives to get some money so you can buy the medicine. Because if you don't treat, the illness will get worse. It might even affect the ear drum. Also the government has not cared for the people - like the hospitals aren't good at all. But other governments, when they care about health and put medicine in the hospitals the people don't suffer. But todays government has not helped at all. It wants people to buy everything for themselves yet some people don't have money and even if you are working the money isn't enough because you are using it on many things. So it hasn;'t helped us - even when you go to the hospital the medicine isn't enough , but I don't discourage her. I keep encouraging, I follow up, I ask her if she has a little money I try top up with my own so she can get the medicine. That is my response.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

She might have a friend, who might be willing to lend money to help. I also advise don't resort to local medicine.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The second question. I counsel the patient and I tell her to buy the medicine. And also take it in the prescribed time and also eating something before taking the medicine. Also not being so stressed. Because such things happen. Also I tell her about clinics where she can get the medicine. The different is she is the one to buy the medicine and I will get to know which day she will buy the medicine. That is my suggestion.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I also tell her this. That life is expensive these days, so you have to buy the medicine. The government doesn't care about us, though they bring the medicine in hospitals - it isn't enough. So you have to invest in your life. So you have to buy your medicine, so that you can be alive. The government hasn't helped us - it is just taking from us. We have to invest in everything, especially life. If you don't invest in life - you will die.

They all did a great job for the country because it was all about health but I thank the VHTs who came from far. If I am to respond to the other question the patient has to try as much as possible to buy the medicine, because in the government hospitals - sometimes there is no medicine other than Panadol which can't heal her problem.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Now for today's question of Annette asking for treatment for her itching ears, I personally refer her to the health centre to get pain killers. They can also examine her and if they have no medicine for her problem, they can write it down for her to get it from any pharmacy. If she insists on getting antibiotics I explain to her that I examined her ears and there's nothing like pus or perforations. Such ears don't need antibiotics and if we apply them she may get some side effects because it would be the wrong medication. I strengthen her and advise her to go to the health centre for medicine that can stop that itching. In case they don't have it, she can get it from the pharmacy after them writing it down. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my fellows. Now for today's question, I cannot give Annette antibiotic drops even if she insists. I don't and I explain to her that it's because her ears are normal. I also see no treatment that could be given to her because it's just itching and I have no medication for it but I can tell her about some of the causes like too much heat, wax and fungus infections. I then refer her to the health centre for further examination. She can get the treatment from there because I personally don't have it.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow members. Thanks for today and yesterday's work. We discovered yesterday's that Annette has itching which could be as a result of a skin infection. Antibiotic drops cannot work for her in this case but if she insists, I refer her to a doctor in order not to upset her. The doctor can give her panadols to ease the itching and deworming tablets because it's possible she may be having worms causing the problem. Another thing I can do not to upset her is to send her to specialists and if they discover something, they can let her know and I get her the medicine.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all. My name is Gordon. Now if I find that lady Annette from Makata with itching ears and she insists on me giving her antibiotic drops yet on examining there was no problem inside, I don't give them to her. I refer her to a bigger hospital for examination. We looked at some of the causes of itching yesterday like fungal infections, too much heat and too much wax. I cannot give her any medication but rather refer her. That's what I have to say. It's me Gordon from Makata.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings our fellow VHTs. Sorry Hadijja but God cares. After checking Miss Annette like we saw yesterday and find there's nothing in her ears but she insists on me giving her antibiotics, I explain to her that it's not necessary because there's neither a wound nor pus. I explain to her some of the causes like inserting sticks and then refer her to specialists. She may be having the fungal infections we talked about or even allergy.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for the work and for replying to the questions. The reason as to why you haven't been hearing from me is because my charger had a fault. But this is my reply to the question. The advice I can give Annette is not to use the antibiotic drops because they are only used when someone has pus or perforations in their ears. I advise her to keep her ears clean and in case there's wax, we can put oil to soften it and then do an ear washout after 5 days. If the itching insists, I tell her to visit the health centre for further examination. That's my opinion on today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks for the work you're doing. Thanks to those who have replied to the question. I won't differ so much from my fellows on the issue of Annette who has itching ears. Truth is some people feel like they know a lot more than everyone else so they can push one into doing something that may cause damage to them. If she insists she needs the antibiotic drops yet I checked her ears and found nothing, truth is I don't give them to her. If you apply medicine without any disease it becomes poison and I cannot give someone poison that would be harmful to them. I explain to her that I can't give her the medicine because it's not necessary for her condition and then refer her to specialists to find out the cause. That's how I can explain to her personally.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work. This is my reply to the question. If Miss Annette insists on me giving her antibiotics, I tell her it will bring problems for her since her condition doesn't need them. I tell her I would if she had pus or any other discharge, or had a perforation on the ear drum. The advice I can give her is to go to seeta Nazigo health centre for further examination and treatment. I personally don't have the treatment for it.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hi VHTs, for todays question please say what you think the problem is with the above ear, and how you want to manage it. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	How have you been VHTs? Thanks for the work. I was unable to answer yesterday's question but I'll answer it now. According to what I see in the picture, I would ask that person if they have any pain or hearing loss. If they say they don't have any I ask if they would like to be referred because it  requires money. I personally don't think that ear can be fixed and put it in its right form like a normal ear. I think God naturally created her like that. She was born that way. But if they ask for a referral, I would go ahead and refer them. If there's no other problem like pus, pain, tinnitus I just tell her God created you like that. That's my reply to yesterday's picture.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	And this is my answer to today's picture. When I see that person I refer them to ENT specialists for surgery and further information because they know more than I do. But I personally know nothing so I just refer them. That's what I have to say about today's picture.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	When I look at today's ear in the picture that has been given to us I see a hole behind the pinna. I remember they told us if the skin of the ear drum grew from inside, the behind part of the ear looks like that which is called cholesteatoma. That's what I see to day.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all VHTs and our bosses. I am sorry I didn't answer yesterday's question because my phone was dead. Thanks to those who replied. Now for today's question I am being asked what I can see in the picture. I see an ear that has a hole behind the pinna and we were told that hole is called post auricular fistula. What I can do for a patient with that condition is to refer them to specialists. I personally don't have the treatment for such an ear. That's how I've answered that question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	How I can handle that condition is by referring the patient to specialists. They can decide what to do for them.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thank for all the work you're doing Catherine, Bryan, Andrew and fellow VHTs. I welcome you back Catherine and Bryan wherever you were. In the picture, I can see someone holding an otoscope but they are not holding it the way they're supposed to. That's what I see. Good night. It's me VHT Johnson Matthew.	case study	TRUE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Patricia - it is actually called 'Microtia'. It can be fixed with surgery so it is important to tell the child that. It is not something caused by God, but it is a congenital abnormality.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Dorothy. Actually, this hole behind the ear is a 'post-auricular fistula'. It can be a result of an untreated cholesteatoma, but the hole itself is not called cholesteatoma.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for today's work. Thank Andrew, Catherine and Bryan for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. This is my answer to today's question. I can honestly see a hole behind the ear. That hole is in most cases caused by a disease from poor hygiene whereas some are born with it. It's like cholesteatoma. The way the hole is formed is like...I think they call it post auricular. That's how I see it. In such a case, this is how I handle the patient. I encourage them to maintain cleanliness and to visit the health centre earlier before it gets to the bone. Once it gets to the bone it may cause damage to the brain leading to diseases like cancer. That's how I've answered today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs. When I look at that pic I see a hole behind the ear. It's like a disease called cholesteatoma. I can handle it by explaining to the person what it is and then referring them to specialists for treatment.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and thanks for the work you're doing. I can see the skin of the ear drum has been pulled in which I call cholesteatoma. It needs referral because it can only be handled by specialists and it's so dangerous.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to today's question. I can see a deep hole behind the ear and the disease is called cholesteatoma. As VHTs we cannot handle such patients so we refer them to specialists known as ENT surgeons. Greetings to you but pray for me. I am puzzled with this child. May God have mercy on me and you too. Good night. I remain Hadijja.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Ok Thanks for all our answers - the hole is behind the pinna. It is called PRE-AURICULAR FISTULA. This is NOT  a cholesteatoma like some have suggested. Francesca it is also not the ear drum - you can only see the ear drum by looking inside the ear using the otoscope - this is the outside of the ear. Harriet, you are right in saying you need to refer to specialists, and that this can cause damage to the bone, however it will not cause cancer. It is more likely to cause a brain infection.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

Am waiting for your response, I am here with the patien	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	I also greet you my fellow VHTs, thank you for the work you are doing, greetings Mrs Isabella, about that issue, as me Nora this is how I respond to you, I also had the same issue where Mrs Anna who got the same problem yet we had washed her out and gave antibiotics, but when she came back to me, I did what I was told in the meeting, I washed her again and gave her antibiotics, now she's feeling okay and she no longer her pus in the ear, I was suggesting may be you do the same to your patient, you do a washout and give her antibiotics, the pus will stop, I encourage other VHTs to give their ideas, thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Well done Isabella, what you need to do for that patient according to what we were told in the meeting, you have to do it like Nora has explained to you, do another washout, because the ear might be having a wound so you need to do a washout of about three times, then you give antibiotics, then you give her some pain killers to reduce on the pain, that is my suggestion.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Catherine told us that the wound takes time to heal since its inside the ear, so you have to explain that to the patient as well such that she can go ahead with the treatment.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Well-done Isabella, thanks for the work you are doing, sorry about that patient I think the days we were told for the ENT doctor who is coming are close therefore you can do as Hadijja had said as we wait for the doctor may be on 29th in case it doesn't work then she has to see the specialist if the antibiotics can't work because her ear problem might be worse because in most cases she can't hear and when you talk to her on the side of the ear which has a problem she can't hear you, I don't know whether she was seen by a specialist last time, but this time she has to see them otherwise if she needs surgery as we were given chance, she can go to Mbarara after being examined by the specialists.	case study	FALSE	SE	none
QA-SE	QA	SE	Thank you members for all the treatment and advise you have given to Isabella, it is the right thing to follow, I request you Isabella to do the way other VHTs have suggested until that day of 29th when we expect to see a specialist, so you need to follow up the patient to see how she is doing then we can refer her to the Doctor who can give her more treatment, thank you so much to those who have given their views.	case study	FALSE	SE	C&I
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs. Please tell me what you see here, the name for it, how you would manage it?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow members or workmates. I can see a hole outside the ear. I think if that hole is a problem to the person, they need to be referred to an ENT specialist. The ENT specialist knows what to do. Sometimes it's dangerous and at times the person was born like that. If it's dangerous I just refer the person to Mulago or Mbarara. That's my answer.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you. After opening my phone, I can see a picture that has been sent to us. The picture is of someone's head and ear. The ear which is our main concern has a hole which I think is a sinus. Most of the time the person is born with that hole. It is hardly dangerous to the person but if it is swollen or has any wounds, I can apply antibiotics for the wounds to dry. I don't think there's a big problem that can come out of it because most of the time it's congenital and poses no risk. Thanks so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs, Andrew, Bryan and Catherine. Thanks for the work you're doing for us. When I see that picture I see a hole. That hole in most cases is congenital but sometimes it's an infection with discharge coming out of it. If it's just like that with nothing coming out, I encourage the person and tell them there's no problem. But if it has any damage I refer the person to a specialist for further examination. That's my reply to the question.	case study	TRUE	SE	QA
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellows wherever you're. Thanks for the work you're doing. I can see an ear with a hole in today's photo. People have that hole with no pain at times and from what I see it's not painful. If it was painful the person needs to see doctors. That's my view. The hole is called a sinus.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all our health workers, Mwebe, Andrew, Bryan, Catherine and thanks for what you're doing for us. I would like to thank all the VHTs and our supervisors for everything you're doing. I can see a picture of someone either a child or an adult plus an ear which I think is the left one. If the person was born with that hole which we call lukatu in Luganda, it poses no threat. But from what we have been told if it causes problems like swelling, the advice I can give to the person is to refer them to an ENT specialist for further examination. The biggest problem is what we copy like pricking ears with machines which makes the ear look like two in one. That's my view. Thanks so much. It's me Matthew Johnson, VHT Makata.	case study	TRUE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing for the country. Now it's me Hadijja and I have seen today's question. I can see a picture of an ear and the question requires us to explain what it is and how to handle it. I personally think people who have those holes and are born with them. May be some develop them when they are older. You never know. If I find one with it, I first ask if they were born with it or just developed it. If it just developed it means it's dangerous. If they were born with it it's hardly dangerous. Greetings and I wish you well as you reply to the question. May God be with you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks VHTs for your responses. Once Catherine has read them she will give you feedback. Thanks for your patience.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings ladies and gentlemen. Thanks Catherine for the work you're doing. For today's picture this is my reply. Most times people are born with that hole because my child has it too on both ears but it has no problem. But in case I find someone with it and with discharge or itching, I advise them to buy antibiotic tablets in order to ease the pain. That hole is called pre auricular sinus. Many people have it but it has no problem. That's what I have to say about today's photo.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	What is the "hole" called Luke? There is a technical term to describe it which you should now be aware of . If you are not I advise you to refer to your booklet from the training day in January.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Karl. Yes, this is a pre-auricular sinus, and yes most of the time it does not cause a person problems. However, if it is swollen it needs antibiotics and referral to a specialist (surgeon) to drain the pus and to remove the sinus to stop it getting re-infected.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Totally correct. The "hole" is called a "pre-auricular (in front of the ear) sinus (hole)"	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. I thank our bosses Andrew, Catherine, Bryan and Hannah for the work you're doing for us. May God bless you. I have also just seen the question because my phone has been having a fault since yesterday when Bryan updated WhatsApp. Honestly I had given up on it. It wasn't showing anything not even any name. There were only two groups remaining and that's it seeta Nazigo and VHT. In the photo I can see someone with a hole on the ear at the front not the back. I can see that it's okay. Normally if it is not an infection, most people are born with it. May be when they get it after they've grown up due to infections but this one to me looks like the person was born with it and has no problem. I remember we were told during the training that it's called pre-auricular sinus. If it has a problem I refer the person to specialists because I can't do anything about it. If it has no problem I encourage them telling them it has no problem and to feel free like me. Also not to worry that it could cause hearing loss. Thanks so much.	case study	FALSE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	All of you fellow VHTs, Andrew, Bryan, Catherine in your respective areas, I have just received this question. My phone was showing the word no service in place of the company name MTN. After switching it off is when I received the question but all along I thought it was a general problem from the company. I have seen the question very late. Forgive me. In the picture it's like there's a child but an older one who was born with something like a hole on the pinna. I usually see them on people but they hardly have any problems with them like pain. If I find someone like that having a problem with it, I don't give them any other advice but refer them to any ENT specialist for further advice or even treatment. But from what I know they hardly cause any pain unless the one bearing it experiences some changes otherwise they never have any problems. It's congenital so I advise the person to go and see ENT specialists. That's how I can handle it. I remain VHT Gordon at Makata. Thank you so much though I've replied late. I am sorry.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

I hadn't replied to the question because my phone was dead. The hole we are seeing in the picture on that person's head is called pre-auricular sinus. Most of the time like our fellows have said, the person is born with it and may not be dangerous. But if they discover it's dangerous by discharging pus and swelling, the person needs to see ENT specialists for treatment. What I can do is to make them a referral for surgery. That's my view.	case study	FALSE	SE	none

QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Greetings to you all fellow health workers a part of the ear project and other things. I personally haven't understood something which I would like to before giving any advice. Edward does that man, woman or child feel pain at the hole we looked at last time or it's just swollen?	case study	FALSE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Also Edward, if they feel pain I advise you give them pain killers. After the pain killers and the pain reducing, you refer them to a doctor because they are the ones who will be able to handle it. They told us an ENT surgeon can operate it  and it doesn't get re infected or bring pus. That's my view from what Catherine told us. It was the answer on one of the days.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Greetings VHTs. Thanks for the work you're doing. Greetings to our bosses too. According to what our fellow health worker Jovia has found, she says she has got a patient with pus and wounds and needs our help. The way I see that ear, it is swollen and the wounds start right from the pinna and occupy the whole upper part. The part with the pre auricular sinus is deep and there's pus coming from inside. I advise they give her pain killers to feel better which could also dry the wounds. After that they should wash out the pus and then give her antibiotics to apply in her ears. That's what I have to say.	case study	FALSE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Also, if this person is in so much pain with pus coming from the hole I advise they refer them to a doctor who can operate that child. We may think it's a joke yet it's very serious. I am also not sure whether the pus is coming from the ear or the pre-auricular sinus. I am just not sure about that. If it is bad they need to be taken to an ENT surgeon to handle them. Thanks.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. Thanks for the work. This case is not about ear care, but about malaria which some of you requested. Malaria is a very important problem in Uganda. Uganda has the sixth highest number of annual deaths from malaria in Africa. Q1. A mother presents with her 7 year old daughter. She is worried she has malaria. What from the history would make you suspect she has malaria? Q2. How do you test for malaria?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. I have seen today's question and this is my reply. A child with malaria has high temperature and low appetite. That's how you can tell a child is suffering from malaria. In order to confirm it, they need to draw some blood. The blood tells whether it's malaria or typhoid. God bless you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning to you all health workers. This is my reply to today's question. If a mother comes with a child, I first take their history which includes the symptoms and the period the child has had those symptoms. I know when a child is sick they lose appetite but the only way it can be confirmed is by taking a laboratory test. Sometimes the child may be suffering from malaria but then they fail to detect it from the lab. In that case it could be typhoid. Typhoid can sometimes fail to be detected from blood and that is why some patients go to Seeta Nazigo feeling sick but the lab results show they're normal. It means they just checked for malaria and not typhoid.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow VHTs. The question we have been asked shows a mother who comes with their child seeking for help and they are asking us how we can check for malaria. Personally since the mother comes to me feeling worried, I first find out the child's symptoms like vomiting, low appetite,  temperature to see if it's normal and body weakness. Since I don't have the equipments used for medical check up, I write a referral note for the child and give it to the mother to go to the health centre for further examination.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow VHTs. As VHT Gordon when a woman comes with their 7 year old child saying they have malaria, I ask if they have symptoms like high temperature, stomach ache, low appetite and body weakness. If I find out they have all that then I will know their child has malaria. I cannot check to confirm if they have malaria because I am not qualified to do that. However, I refer them to the health centre for blood check up to identify what type of malaria it is because there are many. There is also typhoid and cerebral malaria. That's my reply.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thanks to those who have replied to the question. I agree with all your answers and don't have much to add. I would like to just emphasize the issue of referral. A child like that needs to be referred for blood check up to identify what type of malaria they have. Thank so much for answering the question. That's what I think.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and this is my reply to today's question. How I can tell that the child has symptoms of malaria is by checking for the temperature using my hands. To confirm that it is indeed malaria, I ask them to go for blood check up to find out what type of malaria it is. The temperature may be high but from something else.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	So here are some of the answers for today. In terms of Malaria symptoms: Fever, Chills, Sweating, Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal Pain are all symptoms of malaria. It is important to ask about the history of the fever – the fever of malaria can come in cycles. One day she has the fever, then she has no fever for a day, then the fever comes back.  In terms of the second question, how to test for Malaria you do an RDT which stands for 'Rapid Diagnostic Test'. It a short simple blood test you can do in the field - here is a video of one being done by Harriet and Dorothy.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Morning VHTs. Next part of this case - the question is what is the cause of malaria?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	As Gordon VHT Makata, I say what causes malaria is not sleeping under a mosquito net because mosquitoes transmit malaria. Another type of malaria is caused by drinking unboiled water. Unboiled water causes typhoid. The other type of malaria is cerebral malaria which damages the person's brain. Those are the types of malaria I know. That's what I have to say.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Malaria can be caused when a mosquito which is infected bites someone and transfers the parasite to him or her	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. This is my reply to the question. What causes malaria is a female anopheles mosquito like my fellow health workers have said. Another cause is drinking unboiled water especially amongst children and may be eating mangoes or other edibles before washing them. That's what causes malaria. I wish you well as you answer the question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. Catherine, Bryan and Mr. Andrew greetings too. I have seen today's question. What causes malaria...there are many types of malaria including typhoid and the one caused by mosquito bites. Drinking unboiled water and not sleeping under a mosquito net make someone suffer from malaria. There are several types of malaria best known by health workers above us. That's my reply to today's question. Have a good day.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and our bosses. This is my reply to that question. They are asking us to give what causes malaria but it isn't specific to either typhoid or malaria. It's just malaria. According to the training I had, malaria is in most cases a symptom indicating something is wrong with the body. However, there are many causes of malaria like mosquitoes, typhoid is caused by drinking unboiled water, accidents for instance cutting oneself. That is my reply to the question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	How's your day fellow health workers? Well done! I was unable to reply to yesterday's question but this is what I have to say about it. When a mother comes to me and explains the symptoms their child has like high temperature, rapid breathing, pain in the limbs, from what I know I just advise her to take the child to the health centre for further examination. Observation and assumptions are not enough. I may think it's malaria yet it's something else so they need to go for blood check up to identify what type of malaria it is. As a VHT I don't have the equipments for blood check up neither do I have a thermometer to measure body temperature. That's my reply to yesterday's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to today's question. There are many causes of malaria for example not sleeping under a mosquito net, stagnant water around our houses because it acts as a breeding place for mosquitoes, plants and trees and drinking unboiled water which causes typhoid. All those cause malaria.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. Today's question requires us to give the causes of malaria. First of all, it could be a symptom of another disease in your body or the body's reaction to getting rained on. Secondly, it can be caused by a female anopheles mosquito. Thirdly, typhoid is caused by drinking unboiled water or uncovered food which may have been contaminated by houseflies. In summary typhoid is caused by eating dirty food stuff. Those are the causes of malaria. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all fellow health workers. Like Andrew told us to point out something we may disagree with in a good way, I think typhoid is not caused by drinking unboiled water especially here in Kyaggwe. We could have been affected if our water springs were near toilets but it's not the case. It means unboiled water doesn't cause typhoid in our case but malaria instead since that water acts as a breeding place for mosquitoes. That's what I think.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to today's question. I didn't have OTT yesterday. The question is about what causes malaria and this is my answer. Most people have mentioned not sleeping under a mosquito net for malaria so I'll leave it at that. Let me talk about typhoid. Typhoid affects the intestines and most of the time it is not diagnosed with a blood check up. They usually use waste. It is caused by eating dirty things over and over for a long period of time. This could be through touching soil while digging that may have been contaminated by faeces and after eat a jack fruit or you could be having worms.

I have actually just seen it today but this is my reply to today's question.  Here is what causes malaria. First of all, it is transmitted by a female anopheles mosquito. Secondly, typhoid is caused by eating dirty things and drinking unboiled water. That is how I've answered today's question.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	What I would like to add on is malaria caused by eating half cooked meat and unboiled milk commonly known as brucella. It is also very dangerous and once one gets it, it may not go well with them.	case study	TRUE	none	SE

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. I am sorry I haven't been online but God who is above all has enabled me to be on now. I would like to thank Andrew for adding me back. About the child, I can tell they have malaria even after the mother explaining to me their symptoms by referring them to a big health centre for further examination. There are about two types of malaria I can think of. It could be the one transmitted by mosquitoes or typhoid. If it is malaria, I request for the results from the health centre for confirmation. I know at seeta nazigo health centre they treat it. As long as the patient comes suspecting it could be malaria, I just refer them for blood check up. I also advise them to avoid the following. Tall grass around the house, stagnant water and have to ensure the child sleeps under a treated mosquito net. If it's typhoid, I still refer them and advise them to boil drinking water, use clean utensils and cover their food. Have a good day.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning my fellow health workers. If it's confirmed the child has malaria, I get for them coartem. After getting the coartem I give them three tablets to swallow twice a day and one Panadol to swallow thrice a day. That's what I do for a child that age.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. Hope you are ok. Todays question concerning malaria is as follows: The RDT shows she has malaria. How do you treat malaria in this girl?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good. But remember coartem dose is based on the weight of the child. So the number of tablets will depend on their weight.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellows and thanks for the work. The question says how do we treat malaria. After confirming that the child has malaria, they are given medicine called coartem which they swallow for three days according to their age of 7. They swallow three tablets twice a day. Altogether they have to be 18 tablets to complete a dosage. They are also given 6 panadols. They need to be given a lot of drinks like passion fruit juice to avoid dehydration which is usually an effect of malaria.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers whom we do this work with and our bosses. This is my reply to that question. If that child is found with malaria, I need to get them coartem. I ask the mother to give them three tablets twice a day for three days. I also ask her to give them one Panadol each time they are swallowing it and then advise her to give them milk, groundnuts and other foods rich in proteins given how strong coartem is. They should be given passion fruit juice too to get better.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Please forgive me I had forgotten something. Coartem is given to them in the morning, afternoon and evening.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Thank God who has enabled us to wake up alive. This is my answer to today's question. If they come to me after getting checked and confirming they have malaria, I give them coartem three tablets in the morning then more three after 12 hours. That is done for three days. In those three days I accompany those tablets with one Panadol twice a day because malaria causes pain in the body and headache. Panadol therefore acts as a pain killer that relieves pain in this case but coartem is the real medication for malaria. I also advise them to take a lot of drinks like passion juice, ORS and others. Some think drinks refer to alcohol so they go to bars and buy it claiming the doctor told them to do so and buy alcohol for themselves! They have to be soft drinks so clariy this for those drunk fathers!	case study	TRUE	SE	none

Now for today's question, if the child is 7 years the medication my fellows have said is what we use. There's nothing much I can change but you advise them to complete the dosage and not to miss any day. Some of them when they see the child playing after two days they stop giving it to them.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you very much to those who have answered todays question. You should refer her to the health centre to get the correct dose of an anti-malarial medicine (artemisinin-based combination therapies). If you have an iCCM ‘Sick Child job aid’ you can use this to calculate the dose of the medicine by her weight. It is important you get the right dose based on her weight. You should also recommend the mother makes sure the child stays well hydrated and drinks plenty of clean water. If the child is too sick to eat, drink or take the medicines they must be urgently referred to the hospital. Thank you for the work you are doing and good night.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. Here is todays question. How can you recommend community members to prevent malaria? Do you have any questions about malaria or this case which you are uncertain of and would like us to answer?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings our health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. The question is about what we can tell the community to do in order to prevent malaria. First of all, they should keep sleeping under mosquito nets that were given to them. Those who don't have should try and get them. Secondly they have to slash the tall grass around them to prevent mosquitoes from breeding there. Thirdly they should dispose off all broken bottles around them so that mosquitoes don't breed in there when it rains. Fourthly, they should close windows and doors as soon as it starts getting dark to prevent mosquitoes from entering their houses. Now my question is, does over eating maize and raw or ready mangoes cause malaria?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow health workers and thank God for this day. This is my answer to today's question. We must encourage people to sleep under treated mosquito nets. We should ask them to buy them if they can't get them from the health centre. They need to drain stagnant water around them too. Stagnant water is a breeding place for mosquitoes. They should also close their windows early and put screen nets on them. That's what I have to say about today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Another one is over eating mangoes and maize therefore we should ask them to reduce their intake.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is how I can advise the people in my community to prevent malaria. They should sleep under a treated mosquito net. If it's old with holes, they need to mend it. Secondly they need to slash any bushes around them to avoid mosquitoes hiding there. Thirdly there are always broken tins that can contain some water and that water can be a breeding area for mosquitoes. I always advise them to either remove them or burn them in case they are plastic. They should also close windows or doors as soon as it starts getting dark because it's the time mosquitoes enter houses looking for food or where to hide. If they get malaria, it is important for them to get medication and ensure they complete the dose. In case they don't complete the dose and the malaria recurs it's usually more deadly. My question is why do people complete the malaria dose but still feel the symptoms of malaria? I would like to know why. Some of them say cannot sleep without a mosquito net but still suffer from malaria. What causes that too?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow VHTs. As Gordon, this is how I can advise my community to prevent malaria. They should sleep under mosquito nets. Everyone must have one on their beds. They need to clear bushes around their houses and remove any bottles that may retain water where mosquitoes could breed from. They should also have screen nets in the ventilators so that mosquitoes are unable to pass through them. They need to close the windows too before it gets dark. Those are some of the ways I can tell people to prevent malaria.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Today's question requires us to state what we can tell our community members to do so as to prevent malaria. First of all, we should advise them to sleep under treated mosquito nets. Secondly we should ask them to put screen nets in the ventilators of their houses to prevent mosquitoes from entering them. Thirdly they should close their windows and doors as soon as it clocks 7pm. Fourthly they shouldn't have bushes around their houses. Mosquitoes can hide in those bushes and bite them thus causing malaria. They should also avoid stagnant water around their houses to prevent their breeding. Those are the five ways I can advise people to prevent malaria.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	My question is they always tell us one may suffer from malaria and it damages their brain, what type of malaria causes that?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. You know my name. Today's question requires us to give the ways we can advise our community to prevent malaria. First of all it is important to inform parents to ensure that their children are already under a mosquito net by 12pm. To be honest the mosquito that transmits malaria becomes active at 12pm. Someone may tell you they always sleep under a mosquito net but usually suffer from malaria. It means the mosquito bites them at 12pm. Another one is to drain stagnant water around their homes or put oil in them because oil kills mosquitoes. They should also slash tall grass and bushes. My question is why don't they train us on how to check for malaria because we always work on children?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	My other question is, why is it that someone can get bitten by a mosquito and not suffer from malaria yet another one may? Also why do children under 5, pregnant women and those from western Uganda prone to malaria compared to other people?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I personally say we should improve sanitation in our communities and continue sensitizing people to sleep under treated mosquito nets.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and thanks for the work you're doing. This is what I can tell the people in my community to do to prevent malaria. They should maintain sanitation in their homes.  I also encourage them to clear bushes around them and to avoid keeping uncovered containers that can retain water. They should avoid stagnant water that acts as a  breeding place for mosquitoes. If it is a large pond, oil must be poured in it. Another important one is closing windows and doors when it's still early to prevent mosquitoes from entering. They need to sleep under treated mosquito nets too when it's time to go to bed. That's how I can advise the people in my community to prevent malaria. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well done fellow VHTs. Forgive me for taking long to reply to this question. My data was loaded on MTN yet the sim card wasn't inserted in. I also spent a lot of time at the health centre treating patients. Thanks a lot Andrew. Now this is my answer to today's question. I won't differ so much from my fellows. I must sensitize people in my community about sleeping under mosquito nets. Others include clearing bushes around their homes, draining stagnant water that is sometimes caused by brick laying, avoid planting maize near their houses because mosquitoes breed from there, collecting and burning tins and completing the dose once one suffers from malaria. People swallow half way and assume they are okay because they feel better. My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? The other advice I can give to them is to close windows when it gets dark. May be avoiding using dirty utensils for food and eating cold food. That's what I have to say.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The question I would like to ask is why do most people who get checked using RDT are not found to be having malaria yet they feel all its symptoms. And when they check using a microscope, they discover it. I would like an explanation on that. Another question is why is it that when someone begins to take malaria tablets their condition worsens. If they weren't convulsing especially amongst children, they begin to. What causes it?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Sorry my battery was dead today but this is my answer to the question. What I can ask people to do is to sleep under mosquito nets, clear bushes around them and drain stagnant water because mosquitoes breed from there. Broken bottles should be removed too because they retain water. My question is why does fatigue cause malaria?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Harriet this is the answer to your question of why malaria may fail to be detected using RDT but a microscope instead. RDT is only used to check malaria. The microscope shows a lot including typhoid. You very well know here at Seeta Nazigo before they introduced RDT, the microscope couldn't detect malaria even when someone felt so much pain. Typhoid can hardly be seen in dispensary or government health centres. It's commonly detected in clinics.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good evening VHTs; thank you for answering todays question and for your efforts. First off they should sleep under an insecticide treated bed-net. They should make sure the net does not have any holes in it. They should try close windows and doors at night time when the mosquitos are active. Wear long clothes – covering the arms and legs.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Why I am asking this question is because there are some organizations with the ability to equip their employees to work in rural areas especially those far away from the health centre.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	May be another question is, is it possible for you people who helped us with the ear project to help us with malaria too?

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you. It's me Isabella Kizza. Forgive me my airtel network ain't good and as I speak now I just climbed a tree. What I would tell the people in my community about preventing malaria doesn't differ so much from what my fellows have said. They include sleeping under a treated mosquito net, slashing tall grass and clearing bushes around their homes, covering holes that retain water now that we are in a rainy season and removing broken stuff like basins and bottles. They should also close windows and doors as early as possible before mosquitoes enter. They need to put screen nets in their windows too. That's what I can tell the people in my community. To answer Edward's question of whether eating so much maize can cause malaria, I think it doesn't. When someone eats the body reacts and their temperature rises which blacks mistake for malaria but it's just high temperature and not malaria. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

SE-SE	SE	SE	Good morning fellow VHTs and well done. I welcome back my fellow VHTs who were at the health centre on 10th. Thanks for the work you did for our people.

I was unable to spend the whole day there because it was a day for prayers. I also apologize for not answering the questions since then because my phone got problems. I couldn't any messages even after pressing send but it's now okay and I am online.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my answer to the question fellow health workers. It doesn't differ so much from what my fellows said. We can prevent malaria by sleeping under treated mosquito nets, clearing bushes around us, cleaning our compounds and ensuring there are no holes to retain water, burning any tins like the ones of Vaseline and bottles since they also retain water where mosquitoes can breed from. That's how I can advise the people in my community. My question is, people in our areas ask us that since we advise them to sleep under mosquito nets and the government gives them those nets free of charge, can't they also give them the medicine used to treat them? Some of them are low income earners so after washing them they cannot afford it. That's my question. Have a good Sunday and regards to you. I apologize for being the last one to answer the question.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks Madam Catherine for replying to me very well. The incorrect answer I saw was from Luke about ensuring children are put under a mosquito net by 6pm. I know the female mosquito that transmits malaria begins doing so at 3am not 6pm. If it was the case then all children would be sick. 6pm is too early and not only children suffer from malaria but also adults. What I have to say is we sleep under mosquito nets that ain't treated and that's why mosquitoes bite us. Sometimes they have holes. Anyway it is not right to say children should be put under mosquito nets by 12pm because adults are affected as well. That's what I want to clarify. Female mosquitoes bite from 3am.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Some people may not sleep under a net, yet eventually their risk of getting malaria is much higher. If they are bitten by mosquitos which are active at night that is a major problem so you should advise everyone to sleep under nets.	case study	TRUE	none	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	This is an excellent answer Karl	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Karl asked "Why is it that someone can get bitten by a mosquito and not suffer from malaria yet another one may? Also why do children under 5, pregnant women and those from western Uganda prone to malaria compared to other people? Karl. To answer your questions, some mosquitoes carry malaria Karl, others do not. Therefore one person might be bitten by a mosquito like the female anonphales which carries malaria, and the other person may be bitten by a male mosquito which does not carry it. Those in western Uganda have higher rates of malaria as the number of mosquitoes there are higher. Pregnant women and children have weakened immune systems compared to adults so are more likely to get malaria. Qiana asked  My question is many people sleep under mosquito nets without any holes but complain of malaria which they treat it in vain. What causes that? Qiana, thank you. To answer your question: Although they might be sleeping under a net with no holes, they could have been bitten at any other point before they fall asleep. For example at dusk when they are collecting water. It only takes one bite to get malaria. Francesca asked My question is why does fatigue cause malaria? Francesca, malaria causes fatigue as you get fevers, get dehydrated from sweating and the body feels weak. Also it can damage the red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. Isabella asked "They train them to do blood check ups for malaria. Is it possible with us too?" Isabella - thank you for your enthusiasm. Right now we are not able to provide RDTs and medicine for malaria to the VHTs, since we only have a small amount of money. We think though that now you are aware that if a person presents to you with the symptoms of malaria you will know to advise them to get an RDT, check for malaria and refer them to the health centre to seek treatment if they require it. This is something you should ask the supervisors of Omni Med since they are the ones who are responsible for other disease except the ear.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for the work you're doing. Well done Andrew, Bryan and Catherine. I have just seen the question. From the symptoms, I first ask the mother to take the child for blood check up. If the tests are negative I give the child pain killers. Sometimes malaria causes ear pain. Now when I look at the picture, I can see the ear drum is swollen. I can also see some red dish part that appears like it will soon produce pus. That's what I am personally seeing. Thank you so much. I love you and I am with you spiritually. I will keep answering the questions and will see you when I get back.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I think my phone is not clear but what I am seeing is brown stuff and the light of the otoscope. I said I wasn't seeing anything because a brown color is all I could see.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you very much for those who have given opinions on the question. Here you can see an enflamed, red, bulging ear drum. There is no perforation or pus however. This is called acute otitis media.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. We are still on the same case. Here is todays question: You think Joyce has acute otitis media, without a perforation. You are asked by Joyce’s mother what to do and how she should treat it. What do you advise her? Thank you very much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. I refer the mother to specialists. The specialists are the ones that can treat the child.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If I find that child Joyce has acute otitis media and the mother asks for what to do, I tell her the child needs referral to a bigger hospital so they could be treated by an ENT specialist. That's the only advice I can give her as a VHT because I am unable to treat that child.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I inform the mother that the disease can heal without treatment because I don't have the medicine for it as a VHT. The ear has no pus neither does it have a hole for me to dry mop or give antibiotics.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and our three bosses. Welcome back from where you were. Thanks Catherine for translating for us yesterday's question. Now for today's question of Joyce and her mother, once I find she has acute otitis media I can't handle it as a VHT. What I can do is to refer them to a specialists who can help them. That's my opinion since we are sharing ideas and learning. It's me your fellow health worker Johnson Matthew. Have a good day.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The treatment I can give to that patient are pain killers to reduce the pain in their ears. I then refer them to see specialists in ear problems. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers whom we do this work with. I also first give pain killers to that patient to reduce the pain they feel and then advise them to go and see specialists. The other thing I could advise the mother to do is to cover the child's ears while bathing her so that water cannot go in there. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you my fellows and thank you for the work you're doing. That disease of acute otitis media is beyond me but because of the pain the child feels, I advise the mother to give her some pain killers like Panadol to feel better. I then refer them to ENT specialists for treatment before the disease worsens.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. The advise I can give to the mother of that child is to buy her pain killers to swallow for two or three days. If there's no change, I ask them to continue giving it to her. If I follow up and find it still didn't work, I then refer her to a bigger hospital. That's my answer to today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-SE	C&I	SE	Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and thanks for the work you're doing. How are you our bosses? Thank God for enabling you to serve us. I also thank our interpreters and may God bless them. How are you our supervisors Edward and Dorothy? Thank God who has protected you. Fellow VHTs, I love you in Christ. Now this is my answer to today's question. If the mother of that child asks me what to do, I advise her to buy her pain killers because of the pain and as a form of first aid. Truth is I am not the one supposed to treat that kind of disease so I refer them to ENT specialists for treatment. There is no pus to wash out or a hole so I cannot handle them. That's my answer to today's question.	case study	FALSE	SE	C&I
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you very much for those who have taken time to answer the question for todays case. Most cases of Acute Otitis Media occur in children under 5 years of age. They should take pain killers such as Panadol and after 48 hours they should start to feel better. Most children do not need antibiotics, however if it does not improve in 48 hours you should re-assess the child. You should also advise the mother to treat any other issues Joyce has – since she is coughing a lot and feverish you should advise her to check whether or not she has a respiratory tract infection and treat this if so. If the child keeps getting otitis media frequently there is an operation which puts little tubes called grommets in the ear drum (see picture below). This helps to reduce the risk of perforation of the ear drum.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Children who have otitis media a lot are more at risk of developing hearing loss later in life. The next question will be released tomorrow morning. Good night VHTs.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Ok thanks Gordon. Not necessarily true. For ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA (AOM) you can usually wait for 2 days to see if the child improves. They need pain killers and if they feel better no need to refer to a hospital.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Check your booklet - it has a section in it about AOM. It will guide you.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Morning VHTs - here is the next part of the case. After explaining to Joyce’s mother how to treat it she asks you what causes Acute Otitis Media. What do you tell her?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for all the work you're doing for the country. Thanks for all you have sacrificed to treat people. May God bless you. I am sorry for being silent but it's because I lost someone and just came back on Sunday night. I turned off data during the period and forgot to turn it on. I also had malaria, was so down and it's only yesterday that I got some energy to go to Seeta but I am sorry for not replying to the question on Monday and Tuesday. Now this is my answer to today's question. When the mother asks the cause of acute otitis media, I tell her the child's immunity is still very low. I also explain to her that the condition is temporary. Regards to you all and I wish you well as you answer the questions. Catherine, Andrew and Bryan, I am on my way coming. May God bless you.	case study	TRUE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Welcome back fellow VHTs from today's meeting. This is my answer to today's question. If the mother asks me the cause of acute otitis media, this is what I tell her. First of all, children have low immunity and some are malnourished. I therefore advise her to feed that child with a balanced diet. I also tell her that if the child catches a cold or suffers from cough or malaria, they should get treatment for them as soon as possible because not treating them in time causes that illness as well. That's what I can tell the mother if she asks the cause of acute otitis media.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This is my reply to the question too. What I can tell the mother is to feed that child with a balanced diet for example beans, soya, eggs if possible and others. Truth is children don't have white blood cells that fight against diseases. I explain that to the mother as well. And also ask her to cover their ears while bathing. That's my answer.	case study	TRUE	none	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	I teach that mother about ear diseases and also explain to her that the child's problem is common amongst children because their immunity is low. I also explain to her how to take good care of ears.	case study	FALSE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If Joyce's mother asks me the causes of acute otitis media, I tell her that since the child is young her body cannot fight against diseases. I also tell her that severe malaria causes it too. I then advise her to feed that child on a balanced diet and to treat them if they suffer from malaria because those are the two biggest causes of that disease. That's my answer to today's question.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow members. The question requires us to give the causes of acute otitis media. It is mostly caused when the ear drum bursts. Those children are likely to suffer from severe malaria too because their bodies are not strong enough to fight against diseases.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings too fellow VHTs. What I can do for the mother when the child suffers from that disease of acute otitis media is to counsel her by telling her many children suffer from it. I also advise to feed the child on a balanced diet for her to be well.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my friends and thanks for the work you're doing. Welcome back from the training though I wasn't with you but I believe we were together. I thank our bosses for the work they're doing. May God bless them. I have also seen today's question and I won't differ so much from my fellows. First of all I encourage the mother not to be afraid because it happens in children because their bodies are weak. What causes the disease is poor nutrition since most children have low appetite. Balancing their diet is also hard yet they need all kinds of food. I also tell the mother to maintain hygiene and not to pour water in their ears. Also they need to find out and treat any other diseases like malaria and cough because they cause acute otitis media. We know pain killers cure the disease in two days if there's no other disease. May God be with you. Good night.	case study	TRUE	SE	SE
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hi All VHTs. Thanks for your answers. I think we need to just do some refresher training on acute otitis media. Perhaps Bryan and Catherine can deliver this when I am away as most of the answers today were not correct unfortunately.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Acute Otitis Media (AOM) WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH CHRONIC SUPPRATIVE OTITIS MEDIA WHICH IS WHERE PUS IS PRESENT is just where there is a red, painful ear drum, but no perforation, no pus. It is not dangerous and usually settles with simple pain relief. It is most common in young children under 5, but can happen to anyone at any age. It is usually caused by a simple virus, and therefore does not need antibiotics. Remember antibiotics are only effective against BACTERIA, NOT VIRUSES. Finally the child might also have a cough or cold cause by the same virus.	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for the work you're doing fellow members. Edward's ear is red and swollen and the disease is called mastoid abscess. The treatment for it are antibiotics but taken orally through the mouth. If there's no change, I immediately refer the child to an ENT specialist because if it worsens it can be a very dangerous disease. It can affect the brain or the neck so action has to be taken immediately. Other symptoms could be body weakness, vomiting, chills and headache. To prevent all that, they need to be referred immediately for further treatment.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	f Edward's mother brings him and then I examine him only to find behind the ear is red, I immediately know the disease is called mastoid abscess. If it is not treated fast, it spreads to the brain. The treatment I can give are antibiotics through the mouth but I also tell the mother to take the child to the nearest hospital as soon as possible because that disease is very dangerous. That's my answer to today's question.	case study	TRUE	none	none

QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. While on home visits, we encounter some challenges for example here in Makata there is a child whose ear is deformed. The parents don't agree with helping the child yet the child is for the country. Dorothy the supervisor also went there but the parents disagree with correcting it. What do you think we should do about it as VHTs who help people in the community?	case study	FALSE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Aunt Francesca I request if you can, please take a photo of that child and share it with us here. We shall discuss it when we meet and our boss will see how to handle it. You know some of our people still overlook us. They haven't yet discovered how important we are. They love different people so if our boss accepts and we go there with him, they can probably soften their hearts. Remember a prophet is never respected where they are born. If that child gets help, they will then see the importance.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-QA	QA	QA	Thank you but remember they told us before taking any one's photo, we need to ask for their permission. You just can't take a photo of someone's child. I thought it wouldn't be possible because we are from the same village but our supervisor Dorothy also went there and they still didn't agree.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Francesca I am asking you to take responsibility and we go together for the second time. Last time they saw a different face, this time they will see a different one. I am sure those people know us but I will speak with them again. If they refuse, we let them be. It's true they told us not to take people's photos before asking for their permission and not to insist on treating patients if they don't want. If we try to help them but they show no interest, we should just leave them. Let me know when you think they will be there so we can meet and talk to them. They could be knowing its importance but wondering why we are over insisting. I am waiting for you.	case study	TRUE	QA	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Greetings fellows. Today they have asked us to share or ask anything related to the ear project. I will begin with that child Edward and Francesca are talking about. Truth is I saw that child. I took time and spoke to the parents especially the mother but for all the three times I have been there, she has always told me the truth that the child won't be helped because the father refused. I never got to see the father at all during that period and I discovered later that the person we thought was the father ain't the one. It means when the mother told the real father, he refused. The response she told me that came from him was that the condition is common in their family so the mother gave up on it. The last time we went for a home visit I still spoke to her. Actually the child is now my friend and  every time she sees me, she points at me. I don't think it's necessary to go back and tell her anything to do with that issue again because she also came and saw Andrew, Dr. Daniel and Dr. Esther during the first training but they still didn't come to an agreement. Since it's not our responsibility and the parents who are supposed to do that came to a conclusion that they don't need it, we shouldn't do it either. I also looked at that as a challenge because I found it necessary but the parents of the child didn't like it. The other challenge I have personally encountered among my patients on home visits are the patients I usually examine and  find they have too much wax that can be seen on the speculum. I give them olive oil and they use it for the period they are supposed to but when I go back to do the wash out, they immediately call a few hours after doing it saying they have totally lost their hearing. I have met several of them like that. There's one I met while on one of my home visits with Andrew and she still complains that she lost her hearing. My question is, we wash out people's ears and ensure we have removed the wax but what causes the hearing loss after that? And even after repeating the process right from applying olive oil to the wash out. There's another lady called Harriet from Banda, she has been washed out five times and the last one was done by Andrew but she also says she lost hearing and her tinnitus worsened. My question is what is the cause and is there anything we can do about it as VHTs if we find patients with the problem? We should be told so we begin doing it. Another question is, is there any problem if I use our iodine mixed with warm water for the skin? Please let me know if it's okay or not. Thank you much.	case study	FALSE	SE	none

Some people assume they are symptoms of malaria and conclude it's the case, others think it's because of worms whereas others have no idea why. I suggest we discuss that problem amongst children and adults since they suffer from it too with some not knowing the cause. One may have  diarrhoea and stomach ache without malaria.  In that case, some assume it's because of worms or over eating maize, mangoes and meat. I request we discuss it so that our bosses can sensitize and teach us. Thank you so much.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	This case concerns a young child, Patricia, who is 3 years old.  You go on a household visit with your supervisor and find that her mother reports she is tired and lacks energy. She has been passing diahorrea for the past 48 hours. Her mother thinks that she drank some unclean water. Questions: 1. What do you understand by the term ‘diarrhea’? 2. What are other words for diahorrea in your community? 3. How could children get diahorrea? For example one reason is drinking water that is not clean. Can you think of any others?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all VHTs online and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my reply to the question. Patricia, a three year old child has diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is caused by a lot of things like typhoid and malaria. It refers to releasing watery stool since normal waste should be solid. If it contains some blood, it's called dysentery. I advise the mother to take the child to the health centre or I give them first aid of Oral Rehydration Salt ( 2 spoons of sugar and a pinch of salt mixed with water). That's what I can do. I also tell my community members that diarrhoea refers to watery stool. That's how I have answered the question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Like I said above, what causes diarrhoea is eating dirty stuff, drinking contaminated water and typhoid. There are people who get diarrhoea and stomach ache  as a symptom of malaria. In my community it's called "mbiro".	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Our question is about a sick child called Patricia and the first question requires us to define diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is watery stool that's not as solid as the normal waste. It is identified when someone's stool is watery. Apart from drinking water that's not clean, other causes of diarrhoea include eating dirt, eating different food stuff at the same time, eating lots of fats that one ain't used to, eating unwashed mangoes and typhoid. That's my reply to the question.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all fellow VHTs and this is my reply to today's question. We have been asked to define diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is watery stool and once someone gets it like that three year old child, it just flows. That's how I understand it. The people in my community know about diarrhoea  that it is waste that's watery and the frequency one goes to the latrine ain't the usual one. They call it "mbiro" like our colleague mentioned. There are many causes of diarrhoea especially amongst children. Sometimes it's due to severe malaria. Other children get it when developing teeth, eating dirty things or contaminated food, not washing hands yet they touch lots of dirty things and typhoid. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea I can think of. Another one I had forgotten is sometimes a child may eat food that may affect their stomach or may be allergic to certain foods and the reaction is diarrhoea.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	When I find that three year old child Patricia with my supervisor and they tell me she has diarrhoea, this is my understanding of it. Diarrhoea refers to frequent release of watery stool. People in my community understand it as a condition when someone goes to the latrine frequently and believe it is caused when someone eats food they ain't used to like a lot of meat on festivals. Some people in the village hardly eat it due to low income so believe it causes diarrhoea. Other causes of diarrhoea include drinking unboiled water, eating contaminated food and other food stuff and typhoid. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea that I can talk about now. Those are my answers to today's questions.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. This is my answer to today's question. Diarrhoea is a condition when a child releases more stool than they are meant to in a day. The stool is watery unlike the normal solid one and is released frequently. It is also the reason the child loses energy in their body. Diarrhoea is caused by many things including typhoid, eating dirty things like food contaminated by houseflies, uncovered left over food, dirty mangoes and sugarcanes picked on the way and not washing hands after going to the toilet. People in my community understand diarrhoea that it is when a child releases waste frequently, loses body energy and have watery stool.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Also not deworming children since they eat dirty things can cause diarrhoea.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all fellow VHTs. These are my answers to the questions about Patricia, a three year old child with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is when a person passes out watery stool. People in my community identify diarrhoea when someone passes out watery stool frequently. That person also feels stomach ache, loses weight, energy and appetite. The person also loses water. The causes of diarrhoea include eating dirty food especially children. Children have a tendency of eating uncovered food that could be contaminated by houseflies from latrines or dirty places and that's why it is common amongst them. That's my answer to the question. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	I am sorry for replying in the other group. I had forgotten but I am really sorry and thanks Bryan for reminding me. By the time I remembered, I had already sent it. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thank you Mr. Karl and other health workers but what I think differs from what you think. I know very well that when someone eats dirty stuff, they suffer from typhoid. I think diarrhoea is caused by eating stuff contaminated by houseflies like you mentioned but eating dirty stuff causes typhoid. That's what I think and believe could be the case.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers that we work with. Our health workers Catherine and Bryan, we love you. The first question Catherine asked requires us to define what diarrhoea is. Diarrhoea is when a child passes out watery stool. It may not be that watery but it is unusual and passed out frequently. Normally a person defecates around three or four times a day but with diarrhoea the number of times exceeds that. That's what I think diarrhoea is.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	I am sorry my network was bad. People in my community understand diarrhoea from the stool that is passed out which is usually watery. It is also passed out more times than the usual and like I told you, a normal person is supposed to defecate three or four times a day but for diarrhoea it could be seven. When I see such a child as a VHT, the first aid I can give to her is Oral Rehydration Salt which is a mixture of sugar and salt then refer her to the health centre if the diarrhoea is severe. At the health centre they can give her zinc for children and ORS tablets that are swallowed; one tablet once a day for ten days. That's what I think.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Causes of diarrhoea include stomach upset depending on what someone may have eaten. Secondly that child may have eaten dirty stuff. Thirdly, it could be from typhoid which causes stomach ache and diarrhoea but it mainly depends on the stuff one may have eaten and affected the digestive system. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs. We usually give our opinions. What I think of Karl's answer that diarrhoea is caused by eating dirty stuff differs a little from his. Someone who eats dirty things gets typhoid but diarrhoea is caused by other things. One who eats dirty things passes out stool with blood but diarrhoea is caused by a lot of other things like too much heat in the stomach, eating a lot of food stuff and many others. That's what I think. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs , our bosses and well done. This is my reply to the question of the three year old child with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea refers to passing out abnormal stool. Much as someone is supposed to pass out stool that is soft and not so hard, this one is way soft. It is actually watery and we call it "mbiro". That's my definition for diarrhoea. The people in my community call it "mbiro"( running stomach) while others call it "kidumusi". I think it is caused by eating dirty things like uncovered food contaminated by houseflies or cockroaches, eating faeces, not washing hands after visiting the toilet or after touching dirty things before eating especially children. Children eat whatever they find and it doesn't matter if they have just been to the toilet or from playing. Those are some of the causes of diarrhoea. I advise the person to go to the health centre  for examination since malaria can also cause it. I also advise them to take ORS and other drinks like passion fruit juice. If they can't afford it, they can make it themselves by mixing two spoonfuls of sugar in a pinch of salt and they need to take it frequently. The spoon for measurements should be very small. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for the answers VHTs. The answers are as follows: Diarrhoea is 3 or more loose or watery stools in 1 day or Diarrhoea is a sign there is a germ in the belly. You can get diahorrea for all of the following reasons - Eating foods prepared with water that is not clean or safe. Eating spoiled foods or uncooked meats; Children not washing hands; Caregivers not washing hands; Living in unclean conditions or too close to animals; Flies landing on uncovered food	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Diarrhea is very dangerous if not treated, especially in children under five as they can become dehydrated (i.e. loose too much fluid from the body).   Any children with watery diahrrea that does not settle down after 5 days should be referred to the clinic. Any children with diahorrea and blood in the stool should be referred immediately	case study	TRUE	none	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my fellow VHTs and this is my answer to today's question. Diarrhoea is when someone passes out watery stool more times than usual.

Diarrhoea is caused by many things like fever, eating a lot and eating dirty things especially children. That's my answer to the question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

My apologies to you Catherine. The questions I would ask the mother include how long the child has had the diarrhoea. If she says the child has had it for more than two weeks and it's not getting better, I explain to her that it is not okay. The symptoms of dehydration I can look out for are sunken and watery eyes, dry mouth, rapid loss of body weight, dry skin, dark yellow urine with an abnormal smell and sometimes bloody stool and also if she has had the diarrhoea for more than two weeks.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. I am sorry I answered yesterday's question instead of that of today because my battery was dead yesterday but this is my answer to today's question. The questions I can ask the mother include how long the child has had the diarrhoea, if she has good appetite and how many times she passes out the stool daily. After explaining that to me, I check her for symptoms of dehydration. The main symptoms are dry skin and sunken eyes. What I can do in that case is to refer them to a bigger health centre.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all my fellows and thanks for the work. This is my answer to today's question. The questions I can ask the mother of the three year old child include how long the child has had the diarrhoea, what the child ate and if she gave her any treatment.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	How I can check to see if the child is dehydrated is by looking at the eyes which appear bright if dehydrated. I also pull their skin and if it turns out to be loose, it's confirmation that they are dehydrated. Also sunken eyes.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hi VHTs. Thanks for your answers. The questions you can ask Patricia's mother include: How long has she had diahorrea for?How many stools has Patricia had in last 24 hours?Are the stools watery?Is there any blood in the stools?Does Patricia have a fever? If yes, for how long?Has Patricia been vomiting?Is Patricia drinking? Does Patricia seem very thirsty?Has Patricia passed urine?  Signs of dehydration from diahorrea include: Sunken eyes with little or no tears when cryingDry mouth and tongueThirstLittle or no urineVery tired or restless and irritableMuscle cramps Skin that returns to normal very slowly once it has been pinched (skin pinch test more than 2 seconds)	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs - here is the third part of the case. You ask Patricia's mother the questions. She tells you she has had diahorrea for 3 days, with 5 stools in the last 24 hours. She is tired, has not passed much urine. When you examine her  eyes are sunken and she has a dry mouth. Question: How do you want to treat her?	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings today fellow VHTs and this is my answer to that question. All those symptoms show Patricia is dehydrated therefore I refer her to the health centre.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all VHTs. All the symptoms show she is dehydrated therefore I give her first aid of ORS. I can mix the ORS and give it to Patricia's mother. I then advise her to give it to Patricia as she takes her to the health centre. When she gets to the health centre, I may have written the referral form for the nurses to see what the problem is. If not, I escort them and explain it to the nurses so they can put the child on drip immediately.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. I tell  Patricia's mother that we need to mix ORS which is the first aid. She needs to move with it since the distance from where she stays to the health centre may be long. I ask her to go to the health centre immediately because the child is dehydrated and it is deadly.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings my brothers and sisters whom we work with. My bosses, good morning and well done. Now after checking the child and seeing all those symptoms with diarrhoea at the same time, I first advise the mother to encourage the child to drink even if their appetite is low beginning with ORS. I then advise her to get passion fruit juice since some children get fade up of ORS and prefer that instead. They need to take it frequently to prevent drying of the mouth. After that, I refer them to the health centre where they can be admitted but I advise them to keep drinking almost every second. That's how I can help the mother of the three year old child. May God be with you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Well done health workers. Symptoms like not urinating, passing out stool all those times and sunken eyes are all very dangerous when a child has diarrhoea. We immediately mix ORS and ask the mother to give it to the child until they get to the health centre. I refer them to the health centre because I don't have treatment for the condition.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning my fellows and thanks for the work. This is my answer to today's question. After Patricia getting to that state, we just have to mix ORS and also explain to the mother that the child needs to be taken to the health centre. ORS may not be sufficient to treat her and some parents are lazy. I therefore ask her to take the child to the health centre where they can be admitted because that state is worrying. That's how I have answered today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning brothers and sisters. I won't differ from my fellows about Patricia's issue. I give her ORS but the challenge is one may not be having it at that particular moment and may need to buy it. We can also mix it the easy way using salt and sugar and they need to take it until they get to the health centre. Another thing we may add on is glucose for the child to regain energy. That's what I can do.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. When I see that the child has weakened a lot and is dehydrated, I mix for her ORS. I then ask the mother to take her to the health centre immediately and to give her the ORS until they get there. I also advise her to buy some glucose from any shop. That's my answer. It doesn't differ from what my fellows have said. Have a good weekend.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. The way I see that child, I have no treatment for her condition as a VHT. I am not a qualified health worker therefore can't be permitted to treat her. The advice I can give to the mother is to take the child to a big health centre immediately. I can go ahead and escort her as well because her child's health is in danger at that moment. That's my reply to today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The treatment I can give to Patricia who I find out is dehydrated after checking  is mixing for her ORS.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks all those who replied to todays question - the question was what treatment do you give Patricia.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all.

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellows. This is my answer to today's question. The advice I can give to Patricia's mother to prevent diarrhoea is as follows: don't eat left overs left out in the sun, wash hands with soap after going to the latrine, boil water, only just clean water sources, cook food properly.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow health workers. Thanks for work and I wish you a nice Sunday. This is what I have to say about today's question. I first advise Patricia's mother to be a very clean woman at her home including her kitchen, inside her house and the things she uses to prepare food for the children. I then advise her to get rid of cockroaches and houseflies in the latrines by spraying. I ask her to keep covering her latrine , avoid rearing animals close to the home, not to give children half cooked meat and ensuring children wash their hands after going to the latrine. She must also wash her hands with soap before preparing food for the children, boil drinking water and one used to prepare food. That's my answer to today's question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The advice I give to Patricia's mum to prevent other children from getting diahorrea is this. She has to teach the children to wash their hands and use soap while washing hands - especially using the toilet and preparing food. The toilet has t be covered. Eating warm food, because if it isn't cooked well and becomes cold it can get bacteria. Also don't eat food with flies on or cockroaches. Also give children clean water. Clean water must be boiled - those are some of the things I can tell her so the children don't get diahorrea.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning my fellow VHTs. About that question - the advice I give her. The mother has to be hygienic in her home. She has to boil water, and the toilet needs a cover. Such that flies don't go to utensils or eatables. Also the child shouldn't eat left overs or hot food. Also that washing hands after the toilet. They also have to keep the finger nails short, and also the mother has to wash her hands. They need to use soap. Also the plates and other things they use need to be clean. They have to be washed in time and dry well. So put them on a rack under the sun. They also need that drying rack and a clean jerry can for water. She has to keep the child clean, sweep the compound, not littering the area for pests, and flies. They have to have a rubbish pit where the rubbish can be put and far away so the flies aren't around where the utensils are. Where the toilet has a cover.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs. I wish you a nice Sunday. My advice for todays question - be very hygienic in the home whether in the kitchen, the house, or the things she uses to prepare food. Another thing I advise her is to spray the cockroaches and flies and to not let them to get on the food. Also I advise her to cover the toilet. Another thing I advise her is not to keep animals around the house because Catherine told us that isn't good. Make sure you cook meat well. Also I teach her to tell the kids to wash their hands after they eat and the mum with soap even when preparing the food for the kids. Also giving them boiled water. Also boiling the water at home used to cook food - because using water which isn't boiled also causes diahorrea.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for all the work you're doing. They have sent us those videos above and asked us to watch them, especially the last one then we say what we think of them. These are the notes I have taken. Washing hands is really important for the person mixing the solution and the care taker. It is also important to note that the packet of ORS is poured in one litre of water. The people in the rural areas should be told one litre equals four cups and the water has to be safe. One may see water that appears clean and think it's safe yet it's not boiled therefore we should tell people safe water means boiled water that has been stored well. We should also keep teaching care takers how to give ORS and to ensure all the things used to mix and store it are clean. Since we have discovered that it is common among children, parents must know the number of times to give the ORS and the time to do it. The parent must also know that the things used to mix the solution should be used for one day. She must cover it if not giving it to the child and also keep it in a clean place so as not to get contaminated. Thank you so much.	case study	FALSE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning VHTs and thanks for the work. This case is focussed on malnutrition in children.By the end of the case you should be able to:1. Define malnutrition (Monday)2. Know the importance and causes of malnutrition (Monday) 3. Recognise the signs of malnutrition in a child  (Tuesday) 4. Know how to use a Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tape to assess a child for malnutrition (Wednesday) 5. Know the basic management plan for a child with suspected malnutrition identified in the community (Thursday)6. Know the important health messages they can give to caregivers to about nutrition (Friday) Case: You are on a home visit in Kavuule with your supervisor. At this house there is a 8 month old baby boy, Enoch. You are worried that he looks very thin and want to assess him for malnutrition. A. What do you understand by the term malnutrition? B. What are other words or terms for malnutrition in the community? C. Why is malnutrition in childhood a problem? D. What are some of the reasons and causes why a child might be malnourished?	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. Malnutrition is when a child is not fed on a balanced diet. A balanced diet refers to food with all nutrients for example posho. A child has to be given food with all nutrients so malnutrition depends on what the parents of the children feed them. Some parents do not ensure that the food given to their children is balanced. In my community, the condition is called kwashiokor. The other question is about the causes of malnutrition. Most of the time we live in poor conditions. We would love to feed our children on a balanced diet but we cannot afford it. That's my answer to the question.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Please forgive me. It is common amongst children because their bodies are still developing therefore they need all the nutrients.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Also, those who don't call the condition kwashiokor refer to it as marasmus.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work. This is my answer to today's question. Malnutrition refers to feeding on one type of food daily without changing. In my community, most people call it musana( marasmus). It is common among children because their bodies don't have sufficient nutrients from various foods. Malnutrition is caused by eating the same type of food daily. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellows and well done. This is my answer to today's question. People in my community refer to malnutrition as "musana"(marasmus).Some of the causes of malnutrition include eating food that is not rich in all nutrients i.e. food responsible for body building(proteins), energy giving(carbohydrates) and development of the brain. Good nutrition helps to keep children healthy and makes their bodies strong enough to fight against diseases. They also grow well and turn out to be intelligent. Other causes of malnutrition include parents not taking good care of their children and lack of resources. Some parents overlook important foods like soya beans, silver fish, vegetables and instead feed on foods like meat that they perceive to be more important because they are expensive. That's what I think.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. Malnutrition is when a child feeds on food that is not important to the body. Important food to the body includes body building food, energy giving and one that fights against diseases. In my community we call it "omusana" which I think the whites call kwashiokor but correct me if not. Some call it "obwosi".  It is common amongst children who are not well fed and if their mothers were not having food rich in carbohydrates and that responsible for fighting against diseases while pregnant. Others didn't swallow iron tablets that enable the child to grow healthy. That's what causes malnutrition.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	It is common amongst children especially those living in rural communities because some parents do not know how to feed children. It is therefore our role as VHTs to teach them how.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings and thanks for the work you're doing. Now, today's question requires us to define malnutrition regarding the child called Enoch that we saw from Kavule who was looking very thin. Malnutrition is when someone eats the same type of food daily instead of eating the three different types of food. The three different types of food  include body building food, energy giving food and one that fights against diseases. If you miss out on any of that, you become malnourished. There are people who eat cold food. Cold food is not useful to the body and causes swelling of cheeks and loss of body weight especially amongst children. Eating little food also causes malnutrition therefore one must eat food that's enough for their bodies. In my community, the condition is called "musana". It is common amongst children because their bodies are still developing and their immunity lowers if they don't get the right amounts of food I mentioned. That's my answer to today's question. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. Malnutrition in children is when a child does not feed on a balanced diet which is needed in their bodies. It means eating food that doesn't build the body, provide energy or lacks fats. In my community the condition is called "musana". It is common amongst children because their bodies do not have enough nutrients therefore need to eat food to gain them.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs - thanks to all those who replied to todays question. The question was talking about poor feeding in children. The first one was asking what is malnutrition. When a child does not get enough food to eat to help them grow, develop or fight disease. When a child is wasted or too thin for their height. When a child develops swelling in both feet (oedema). All those tems of malnutrition are good. Also it is important to know about it as the child fails to grow properly, It can affect brain development  and Children with severe malnutrition can die, Some of the reasons children are malnourished ar • They are ill e.g. they have HIV• They do not have access to enough food • They are weaned from breast feeding too early e.g. before 6 months• Not receiving routine vaccines• Lack of a varied diet once they start eating normal food e.g. not enough vitamins and different nutrients like protein	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. This is my answer to the question. We have been asked to define malnutrition in children and how it affects them. Malnutrition in children refers to eating fried food daily. Fried food with so much oil ain't good. We no longer feed our children on non oily food like our ancestors used to do. As long as one eats oily food even if it is ground nuts or chicken, it causes malnutrition. Malnutrition causes a disease called marasmus and children with that disease have loose skins. They need to be fed on soya peas and beans that are not fried. We have all the nutritious foods  in Uganda. I don't differ from my fellows who said malnutrition can also be referred to as musana. We can prevent it by eating a variety of foods for example one can prepare beans and mix them with bananas and about 2 pumpkin leaves. If you do that, the child can get better. The beans shouldn't be fried.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Good morning fellow VHTs and thanks for yesterday's work. Thank God who has enabled you to wake up alive. I am sorry I have just seen yesterday's question now and all the other messages but let me answer it before we receive today's question. In my community, malnutrition is called musana or kwashiokor and it is caused by poor feeding amongst children. Poor feeding means the person lacks some nutrients needed by their bodies i.e. not eating a balanced diet. A balanced diet must contain body building food, energy giving food and food that strengthens immunity and helps the body to fight against diseases. It includes vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and vegetables. All those foods should be given to the child. If they eat all that, they cannot look like Enoch with a thin body, swollen feet and swollen cheeks. We have also been asked the causes of malnutrition. Malnutrition could be caused by poverty but also some people overlook certain things. They claim to not have time to ensure their children feed on a balanced diet so that laziness in taking care of children causes that condition. You find a child feeding on cassava and ground nuts or sweet potatoes for three days without change yet they are still very young. In such a state, the child is bound to become malnourished .	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	It is common among children because they are unable to acquire anything they need unlike adults. Children only depend on their parents. They are also weak and ignorant of what's important for them. May God be with you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	The mother says that Enoch did not receive his vaccines yet, and has been sick since he was born with several episodes of diahorrea and vomiting. You also notice that there is no soap or handwashing basin the house. You go to assess Enoch. What signs might you see if he is malnourished?	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all VHTs and thanks for the work. Today's question is still about Enoch. The symptoms of malnutrition include   first of all, a swollen body. As a VHT I can use my finger to press the swollen part and if it leaves a hole, it means the child is malnourished. Another method I can use is that of the tape called MUAC which stands for Mid Upper Arm Circumference and it has three colors yellow, green and red. If I use that tape and it shows yellow, it means the child is not that badly off but if it indicates red then they are malnourished and need to be fed to get better. That's how I can tell. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings to you all fellow health workers. This is my answer to today's question. After the mother explaining that to me, I can tell if the child is malnourished by pressing their leg and if it leaves a hole it means they are malnourished. If I find out they are malnourished, I advise the mother on what to do. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellows. I can tell whether Enoch is malnourished if his skin is wrinkled. Malnourished children also have potty bellies. They also appear weak and tend to be sleepy all the time. That's my reply.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	When Enoch's mother tells me that, I can tell he is malnourished if he has swollen cheeks, a pot belly and bad skin. Even if such children eat, they cannot look good since they lack some vitamins in the body. They need specialists in nutrition to advise them.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks for today's work fellows. When Enoch's mother explains that to me, I first advise her to get the child immunised with BCG, DPT 1 on their thighs, polio vaccine through the mouth, PCV on their right thigh, vitamin A and IPV on the left thigh. Symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, low body weight and stunted growth. The child also appears sad and has swollen legs and arms. They also look pale. That's what I have to say today.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. I can tell that child is malnourished if he has thin hair, swollen body, pale skin, sad face and stunted growth. Those are some of the symptoms of malnutrition I can give.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings brothers and sisters. Well done! This is my answer to the question. The symptoms I can consider when assessing a child that looks malnourished like Enoch include the following. First of all they look sad and irritated. One can easily tell their bodies lack water, blood, fats, salt and calcium. Such children have very pale skin, swollen bellies, swollen cheeks, sunken eyes, thin hair and swollen legs. They also feel thirsty all the time since their bodies lack many nutrients. They feel weak and pain when one touches them. That's what I have to say.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. Now this is my answer to today's question. I would first of all advise Enoch's mother  to take that child for immunisation like my fellows have mentioned. The symptoms of malnutrition include thin and lighter hair, swollen cheeks, pot belly and sometimes swollen arms. Such children tend to be sickly and take long to heal even with treatment. Another symptom is low body weight for their age. Also, they are always sad and do not play with others and they look tired all the time. If you lay them down on their bellies, the skin from their thighs to the buttocks becomes wrinkled. That's how I can tell if Enoch is malnourished.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings VHTs, Catherine, Bryan and Andrew. When I find that Enoch is malnourished after using the MUAC tape, I advise his parents to refer him since his condition could result into death. Many children in that condition recover after treatment. For his sister, much as she's not ill I advise them to ensure she eats covered food and drinks since failure to do so could cause sickness. I also advise them to feed her on a balanced diet so that she doesn't end up like Enoch. They need to feed her on body building food, energy giving food, food rich in calcium and fats, vegetables and others so that her situation doesn't worsen. Thank you so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and thanks for the work you're doing. When I check Enoch and the MUAC tape indicates he is severely malnourished, I advise the mother to take him to the health centre immediately since his condition is critical. The advice I can give the mother regarding the sister is to take good care of her by giving her body building food, energy giving food, drinks, milk and millet porridge since she ain't that badly off. All she needs is proper care. That's what I have to say today.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs. Today's question is still about Enoch. If I use the MUAC tape and it shows the red colour, I refer the child to a health centre for treatment. There are various foods available for malnourished children. For the sister whose reading for the MUAC tape is green but is thin and has swollen feet, I still refer her. Her feeding may be okay but when she suffers from something else. I therefore refer her to the health centre for further diagnosis. Thanks so much.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings. When I find that the child is malnourished after using the MUAC tape, I advise the mother to take him to the health centre immediately. I also advise her to give the other child body building food. To be honest we grow body building food ourselves so we don't have to buy. Body building food includes beans, soya and groundnuts. I therefore advise her to give that to the child.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	If Enoch's tape reading shows red, it means he is severely malnourished and I cannot treat him as a VHT so I refer him to specialists. The swelling of feet in the sister's case could be a symptom of anaemia. I also refer that child to the health centre to be given more blood. That's my answer to today's question.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers. After seeing that Enoch's tape reading is red, I inform the mother that he needs referral immediately because his situation is worrying. For the sister, I also refer her for further examination to identify the cause of the swelling because it is caused by a lot of conditions. That's how I can advise her.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Thanks VHTs - the correct answer is that because Enochs measurement using the tape showed 'Red' you should refer him urgently to the health centre for thorough assessment. Similarly, for his sister; Refer. Any child with swollen feet on both sides should be referred to the health centre.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Super answer Harriet. This is correct. You refer Enoch to the health center for immediate assessment. And you give Enochs parents that advice to prevent the similar problem in his sister.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hi @256771906092 Gordon - very good. The swelling could also be a sign of malnutrition too so the safest thing to do would be to refer her to health centre so that the medical team can assess her.	case study	TRUE	SE	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	After referring Enoch to the health centre, I advise the mother to give him and other children enough body building foods like soya peas, milk, fruits and other foods. She should feed them on a balanced diet needed for the body.	case study	TRUE	none	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow health workers and this is my answer to today's question. After finding out Enoch is malnourished, this is the advice I can give to the mother. I would advise her to give enough food to the children so that their bodies are strong enough to resist diseases. Secondly, I would advise her to always breast feed her children in case she gives birth to any for at least 1year and 6 months. I would also ask her to ensure all children are immunised and to follow any other advice from the doctors. That's what I can tell Enoch's mother to prevent malnutrition in other children.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellows. What I can tell Enoch's mother is to give her children enough food. Sometimes parents don't give their children enough food and yet the food lacks nutrients. The mother should also reduce on frying sauce with oil and just boil it instead. That will help the child to fully recover.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	How are you our health workers? Thanks for the work you're doing. This is my answer to today's question. The advice I can give Enoch's family is to ensure the food given to the children contains all nutrients. The sauce they could be given includes silver fish and beans. They should also be given drinks, millet porridge and cassava flour which we actually grow ourselves. The children will therefore grow normally and also gain energy and water. If the parents get some money, they can buy for them milk because it contains fats. That's how I can advise Enoch's parents to look after him and other children.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs and thanks for all the work you're doing. The advice I would give Enoch's family doesn't differ from what my fellows have said. I would tell her mother the food needed for the children to be healthy ain't expensive and we can grow it ourselves. The food we grow contains all nutrients e.g. vegetables and fruits which are both very important. That's what I have to say.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Greetings fellow VHTs.  I am back from Mulago and this is the advice I can give to Enoch's parents. I first sensitize his mother to give her children enough food i.e. body building foods, energy giving foods and foods that fight against diseases. That food ain't expensive since we grow it in rural areas e.g. vegetables, beans, posho and sweet potatoes. If a child has all that food in their bodies, it's hard for them to fall sick and they grow up to be healthy and lively.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	What you have said is okay but where shall we get the MUAC tape from? You're the ones with them but we know how to use them because we watched the video. I don't if others know but I personally do from the video I watched.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none

C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Hi vhts so the correct answer is that this is an infected preauricular sinus. It needs to be referred for incision and drainage at the health centre.

QA-QA	QA	QA	Hi VHTs - slight dilemma. We need your opinions on how to handle this matter. Harriet identified a malnourished child in Makata who had a red MUAC tape. The child is 10 months old. The mother has learning difficulties and has no money. She is not able to bring the child to the health centre where they will need to be for a few weeks while the child has the appropriate feed and medicine and is monitored. We have provided them with a referral letter but we want you to advise us  on what you think should be done. Thank you.	case study	TRUE	SE	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Francesca told me that the mother was waiting for me to take her to Mukono HC IV on last Friday at 2pm. I don't know may be she is still expecting a lift to the Health Centre. I was thinking of passing by her house today.	case study	FALSE	C&I	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	This is my suggestion regarding the malnourished child that was found in Makata. We shouldn't deal with just the mum because she has mental issues. I know the child has a father though he's also not okay and a grandparent called Baraza. I suggest VHTs within that area should explain to both the grandparent and father the situation at hand. They should tell them the child is malnourished and was referred to the health centre so that they also get involved. If they don't get involved, then a good Samaritan will have to accompany them and stay with them in case they are admitted. If there's one, that's good but the child's relatives would have been the best. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	QA	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	We heard about that child's situation and this is what happened. She was taken away from the mother by her maternal aunt when she was still very young. After failing to look after her, she brought her back malnourished. Her mother is not okay mentally but we have been advising her to take her to the health centre and to feed her on nutritious foods like soya and beans. Only challenge is both parents have mental issues. Andrew referred her to the health centre but she needs to go with someone. I heard like Francesca saying she would accompany her. Also, that child is not 10 months. She's about to make 2 years though she looks like she's below 1year. We should encourage the father to get some money, and someone to accompany them to health centre IV in Mukono so that they get treatment. I think she mostly needs nutritious food and medicine as the health workers will prescribe. That's what I have to say but that child is way older than 10 months. We know when she was born.	case study	TRUE	QA	C&I
SE-SE	SE	SE	Greetings fellows. Since the one currently looking after the child has mental issues, there's a big problem. If Francesca said she will accompany them to the health centre, we appreciate it but we need to know their nearest VHT. We also need to know a relative who can get involved in this issue because we may dedicate ourselves to helping them and it becomes something else. We are all different. They may take it the wrong way and say we didn't involve them yet it appears they can no longer handle them. The VHT close to them should deal with their relatives who are not mentally ill to find a solution. In case they get treatment, the VHT has to monitor them to ensure they are being given food, medicine and that correct measurements are taken. This should be done with the help of the relative who should also accompany them to the health centre. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	C&I	none
SE-SE	SE	SE	Greetings fellow VHTs and this is my suggestion about the child. It's true the child's father is around but is no better than the mum. The other relative is the paternal grandfather but he is 100+ years. I think much as the parents are not mentally okay, they have done something because the child looks better than she was when they had just brought her. I suggest if the child is given treatment, us VHTs don't stay very far from them and can check on them once in awhile. The mother told me the problem is she doesn't take milk and only takes porridge after being forced. The other food she tries to eat is rice and posho. Also, she can hardly afford it but if she gets it, she's able to feed her. She's also capable of looking after her child since she's not that badly off mentally. I suggest if the child gets treatment, we can check on her every now and then to show her how to give it to her. That's my opinion.	case study	TRUE	QA	C&I
SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thanks for all the work you're doing. About the issue at hand, I discovered the child. After discovering her, I was so touched because she's older than Mulungi but see the way she is. Her mom came to see me after giving birth to Mulungi when she already had her four months ago. Mulungi was only one week and a half then. I found that child in a terrible condition and was able to talk to the father but he showed me he can't do anything about it. I was very touched and wanted to take away the child from them so she could stay with me, but then I would be having many children to look after. I already have Mwesigwa and Mulungi and I am usually busy. Due to that, I decided to leave the child with her parents but this is what we agreed on. She brings the child to my place every morning and I prepare for her heavy breakfast that I feel would be helpful. Also, that child takes milk. She is sick therefore her appetite is quite low but I usually give her milk and pack some for her to take back home. I give her the amount I can afford since I don't have cattle. She eats everything we give her like matooke, rice and Irish potatoes. She always leaves my home at around 11am or midday. I also give her food to eat later on. I suggest that unless someone is going to accompany her to the health centre, she shouldn't go because she won't handle. If there's anyone who can volunteer, please do. I heard someone asking who her nearest VHT is, she is Francesca. As for her husband, hmmm God indeed paired them up. Her father in law is very old like Francesca has told you. He is also very weak. The mother in law is around but also has mental problems. I suggest we come together as VHTs to help them. If one has anything, one can give to the child. She will eat or drink it well. Her appetite is not that low. Have a good day. May God be with you.	case study	FALSE	QA	none
SE-C&I	SE	C&I	Francesca VHT Makata, your ideas are very good. Specioza's child like you have seen in Andrew' message was referred to Mukono health centre IV. A malnourished child who has been referred is sometimes admitted for a few weeks. While at the health centre, they are given food to eat that is sometimes provided by the government. He's therefore asking who can look after the child in a situation where they are admitted for three weeks. What you said is okay if they give them the food and they return home with it. Depending on the child's condition, they are sometimes admitted like in the section of "Mwana Mugimu" at Mulago. They are given food and medicine to get well in such cases. It's not a matter of giving them food before they are seen by the doctor because they are given certain nutrients that are beyond our smaller health centres. That's the point.	case study	FALSE	QA	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	Yes thank you so much to all vhts for these suggestions. Its hard. Ideally she needs to be in a health centre for a few weeks to get special treatment. But I don't think the mum can afford it and she has mental health issues meaning I don't think she can be responsible for the child. I agree with Karl. We should first involve the father and His parents. Some vhts should go in a group to inform them and try come up with a solution which the family think they can manage. If that fails a good samartian might have to accompany the child for a few days.	case study	FALSE	SE	none
QA-C&I	QA	C&I	I agree with the suggestion put forward by our dear vhts to involve the extended family. Since this child is severe acute malnutrition feeding them more food alone will not work at first. She needs a special diet which can only be done in a hospital. Once she has regained strength then she can resume on a normal diet. However even then when she is returned to the mum someone will have to monitor her as she can easily fall sick again.	case study	FALSE	C&I	none
C&I-C&I	C&I	C&I	Also who needs a MUAC tape still ? We have 4 VHTs who have not got one yet - however we bought one for every VHT. Please come to the organisation to collect your tape off Bryan or Catherine this week. I will leave them with a supply for those VHTs who did not get one.	case study	TRUE	C&I	QA
